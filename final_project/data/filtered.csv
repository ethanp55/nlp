5 sent comrades
Sending you both 5
the c group stands for comrades
same here. submitted for 5 each
*soviet national anthem begins to play*
Asiago and Blue are looking for friends.  We could add them to our group for a mega-group
the only thing we have to lose is our chains brothers
We would be the strongest group
mega groups are harder to sustain and easier to betray
smaller group size is better imo
what do yall think?
3 together seems easier to sustain imo
OK.  I'm sending you 6 each.  Also sending to my buddy Blue
"I'm doing 5 this round, sending to blue and asiago too"
Not to Asiago
im sending as many as I can for a total of 5 each
They didn't respond
not asiago?
Blue is legit
Asiago not so much
they've been fine to me but not sure yet
"yeah no you're right, they sent the first time and not again"
sending you both 6 this round
5 to all again 
good group this is
we are the strongest group
do you guys know blue cheese
he was asking to be friends iwth this group
"Yes, Blue is my buddy"
sweet
"Yeah, me and blue have been sending back and forth"
added to group
I say to let 'em in.  They have been consistent
i sent em some tokens
"We would be best on a pizza together, want to team?"
bro letsa go
Im sending you 10
oh my b
ill send more next time
"No worries. If I lift you up, you trade back and help me"
The more we trade the more we grow
"I sent less so I could send some to brie, sorry"
Have you talked with brie at all? They have not said anything
not really lol too many chats
I am just going to send you 10 instead of splitting it
Bro no tokens?
i got kicked lol
Fair

No worries

bro
you have left me to die
:(
why do you choose violence
plotting to attack our cheese brethren
haha hey were just having fun out here
surely you believe in repentance
let us make amends
Looks like Asiago doesn't wanna be homies
wanna keep helping each other out?
Sending you 6 this time.  You might consider befriending Cottage and Camembert (my other friends)
sounds good! wanna make a chat next round?
"Yo, cuold you get me in with the cool cheeses?"
I've mentioned you to them.  Give some to them and I'll keep working on it
Cottage and Camembert
Sounds good
"Hey gouda, thanks for the points! wanna be pals?"
Sure!
I'll give you three
cool same!
I'm so dissappointed :(
can we still be friends?
Sending you 3 this round in return
Sounds good
"I may need some new friends, others are not treating me nice"
"I'm able to send you 2 this round.  I'm friends with Blue, Cambert, Cottage.  Not sure how to integrate you in with us."
Let me see what I can do
"That is fine, don't worry too much"
yo fellas
if we team up now well be unstoppable
"*hollow purple* nah, id win"
"camembert, i gotta say you're a cool guy. Wanna be pals?"
I am friends with cottage cheese and caprino. I think it would be fun to team up!
you're a real one
welcome aboard
Camembert is a part of the other group
he's giving them more tokens than he is to us
Hmm playing both sides
I won't give to him this round
Let's confront him in the chat and ask him to defend himself.
"sorry brie, I'll give you 5 this time"
I totally misclicked
"All is forgiven, I am weak though"
Just us now boys
five each
I'm good with 5
should we try to recruit asiago?
"mozz just attacked, which begins the fall"
Yeah asiago or caprino maybe?
caprino is pretty locked into that other group
Yeah asiago is probably the best best
*bet
let's take some points from taking down mazz
I talked to asiago
do we want to attack?
or just trade?
Next round attack?
yeah
everything against mozz
but three for each of us
I'm good with that for this round
Brie you in?
We attacking mozz?
yeah
Yes
asaigo wants into our group
3 for us and rest from mozz
Sure
Let's let him in
awesome
We are still the weaker group we need to try to take out one of the big guys
this successfull attack with boost us up
"Yeah next round maybe, depending on how this goes?"
gang gang
it is an honor to be in the presence of such cheese greatness
y'all wanna team up?
Sending you each 5
sending each 6
Same^
sending 5 each
6? or 5?
"I'll do 6, why not"
I've trying to give a little to Mozzi
caprino there ar ethreats on your life
Do I drop 'em?
save a few tokens
asiago wants to take you don
^^^
i already defended you in the chat but he might try anyway 
asiago is anti caprino
Thanks for the heads up
we can get him sometime soon
yeah lets target him pretty quick here
no one touches this group and lives to tell the tale
he and I are on good terms but I'll stop sending after this round
team caprino
sounds good
caprino all the way
Nobody attacked -- I saved some at the last moment
Sorry to not give you more
my OG homie
nice
all good
nah we are good to hear you're good
5 each this round from me
5 each from me as well
Same
start maybe saving a token or two we are strong and will likely get attacked soon
be on the lookout
We are the strongest group
we are the strongest group
hahaha
we are the STRONGEST group
"If one of us gets attacked, no worries.  We bring them back up later after eliminating the attackers"
^^^
true
that is the plan
bet
asiago is a trouble maker
asiago sporadically sends me like 9 tokens
haha what??
I've cut contact but that's why they gave me a bunch
hes tryign to make contact however possible
how many tokens this round?
9 tokens this round
Hmm ... they seem to be a societal outcast. What can we do?
i don't trust him so I'm not sending back
one the one hand we can freind him
but he will drag us down
and he has advocated for violence in the main chats
idk how much I trust him
seems like he's out to cause chaos
indeed
chaotic evil is his alignment
true
more like chaotic chatoic
Aligned with the diablo?
6 to each of you this round
6 each my guys
lets hold out strong till the end
6 each <3
6 each
We are the strongest group
"shoot, actually i had to give to gouda last minute"
he game me 4 last round. had to give him lvoe. my bad
you good thanks for the explanation
all good
what's the gameplan?
so like no one has started attacking
Same?
kinda worried. asiago sent 8 this round but i'm not sending back
you think he might turn and attaack instead?
he might.
asiago is desperate for freinds becauuse hes going down he might try to kick on the way down
maybe eveyrone do 5 each save 3 tokens just in case?
we have two options: eliminate the threat immediately or bring him in
5 to each
honestly I say eliminate before bring in
5 each and take 3 from him each?
5 each
I'm undecided.. should we really attack?
he heans't attacked us yet so maybe not
oh dang haha
The other group attack 'em
looks ike someone attacked him
mozarella fell hard someone attacked him
"oh no, that was mozarella"
"Wait, that was mozzi"
they will prolly do one more round of attack on moz and then move to asiago
but idk
Let's attack the other group.  Mozzi wasn't bad
we don't have a clear target yet so I'm doing 6 each
agreed
looks like other group is swiss and gouda
blue cheese sorry man we are trying to make you more popular
and brie
sounds good
no worries! i am the grunt of the group
"yeah, it seems like that group is on good terms with asiago too"
you already brought me up pretty high
They are a tight group.  The gained by attacking mozzi
the other group(s) aren't very well organized
That one is
we coudl gain by attacking asiago
mimic their strategy
we could attak asiago and take him out
5 eahh and 3 on asiago
we want to? 3 steal each?
?
do you think that would make the other team turn on us?
"The threat is gouda, swiss, brie"
done
asiago attacked
same
well that worked out strangely
attack didn't work
hey blue cheese welcome up
Did asiago block it by keeping?
"hmm, it looks like none were taken from asiago... didn't submit?"
he must have blocked
what caused gouda and swiss to drop
?
i accidentally gave him 3 (asiago) instead of take i hit it too fast lol
thats on me
hahaha bruh
I bet brie kept
took this time lol
should we all attack brie?
hehee
gouda and swiss dropped by attacking mozzarella instead of giving to each other maybe
do we want to attack brie? do we feel like that team is oging to be a threat if left unchecked?
Let's attack Brie.  10 each
holy cow
10 each on brie?? 
10 each???
how about 5 each or so
that's a lot
let's do 5
yep
4 to each of you and -5 to brie
yessir!
done
done
how we feeling
They attacked blue
"dang, gouda swiss and brie all attacked me"
other team trying to take blue
fetch
:(
alrright we need to fortify blue cheese and take from them ig
should i keep?
"blue cheese, keep"
yes keep
Let's all attack Gouda with 8 and Swiss with 8
bet
done
attacked gouda and siwss with 8 and kept 2
"mozarella gave me all negative tokens, but it didn't do much"
Same
mozarella diidn't do nothing to me lol
must have not had enough tokens
just realized asiago also attacked me. 
yeah asiago is with that group sort of but not super close it seems
asiago gave me 3 lol
No worries.  We stick together.  Just stick with the plan
idk whats going on with him
We'll help and restore each other
right now defence by offense
sweet!

Nice

"yooo lets stir the pot boys, everyone blast caprino"

Not very cool asiago

woah woah woah
asiago that isnt nice man

"Agreed, lets just be one big cheese blend"
"mozzarella, did you get attacked?"
fiesta blend
No I attacked Asiago
It was my own doing
bro went all in
i got -16
guys lets fight back
mozzarella thank you for your support
"Yo, violence is not the answer guys"
hahaha
"Asiago blocked, I felt threatened by them wanting to fight and being below them"
dang really went rogue
cheese warfare getting out of hand
From the needs of the many to the needs of the few
They kept not trading back to me as well
everyone
we must fight mozzarella
its not a great cheese
"They are desperate, let us not judge. Perhaps we should give instead of take"
Asiago has been lying to me since the beginning
I do apologize for my harsh actions
Would you like to be in our group of refined cheeses?
brie and swiss
yes
i would be honored
awesome
"I have like nobody right now, I will send you 14 if you keep send me at least a few"
That was kinda an awesome play. Respect
