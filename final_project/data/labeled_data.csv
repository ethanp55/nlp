we are the strongest group,4,75
we are the STRONGEST group,4,75
"If one of us gets attacked, no worries.  We bring them back up later after eliminating the attackers",4,77
^^^,7,130

haha what??,5,81
hes tryign to make contact however possible,3,63
how many tokens this round?,5,89
9 tokens this round,0,17
Hmm ... they seem to be a societal outcast. What can we do?,2,47
i dont trust him so Im not sending back,1,30
on the one hand we can freind him,0,21
but he will drag us down,4,70
and he has advocated for violence in the main chats,4,69
idk how much I trust him,4,68
seems like hes out to cause chaos,4,69
indeed,7,113
chaotic evil is his alignment,4,69
true,7,123
more like chaotic chatoic,4,69
Aligned with the diablo?,4,70

you good thanks for the explanation,7,122
all good,7,122
whats the gameplan?,5,98
so like no one has started attacking,5,86
Same?,7,130
kinda worried. asiago sent 8 this round but im not sending back,3,66
you think he might turn and attaack instead?,5,99
he might.,3,58
asiago is desperate for freinds becauuse hes going down he might try to kick on the way down,3,58
maybe eveyrone do 5 each save 3 tokens just in case?,2,44
we have two options: eliminate the threat immediately or bring him in,5,98
5 to each,0,19
honestly I say eliminate before bring in,1,31
5 each and take 3 from him each?,5,83
5 each,0,19
Im undecided.. should we really attack?,32
oh dang haha,7,126
The other group attack em,3,59
looks ike someone attacked him,3,59
mozarella fell hard someone attacked him,3,59
"oh no, that was mozarella",7,126
they will prolly do one more round of attack on moz and then move to asiago,3,58
Lets attack the other group.  Mozzi wasnt bad,1,41
we dont have a clear target yet so Im doing 6 each,1,36
agreed,7,113
looks like other group is swiss and gouda,3,52
blue cheese sorry man we are trying to make you more popular,6,111
sounds good,7,114
no worries! i am the grunt of the group,7,122
"yeah, it seems like that group is on good terms with asiago too",4,73
you already brought me up pretty high,0,23
They are a tight group.  The gained by attacking mozzi,4,77
the other group(s) arent very well organized,4,76
we coudl gain by attacking asiago,1,32
we could attak asiago and take him out,1,32
5 eahh and 3 on asiago,1,35
we want to? 3 steal each?,5,83
?,5,98
do you think that would make the other team turn on us?,3,58
"The threat is gouda, swiss, brie",4,70
done,7,113
asiago attacked,3,59
same,7,130
well that worked out strangely,7,128
attack didnt work,7,129
Did asiago block it by keeping?,3,65
"hmm, it looks like none were taken from asiago... didnt submit?",5,97
he must have blocked,3,65
what caused gouda and swiss to drop,5,97
?,5,98
i accidentally gave him 3 (asiago) instead of take i hit it too fast lol,6,107
thats on me,6,107
I bet brie kept,3,65
should we all attack brie?,1,32
gouda and swiss dropped by attacking mozzarella instead of giving to each other maybe,3,59
do we want to attack brie? do we feel like that team is oging to be a threat if left unchecked?,1,32
Lets attack Brie.  10 each,1,31

cheese warfare getting out of hand,7,125
They kept not trading back to me as well,4,67
we must fight mozzarella,1,31
"They are desperate, let us not judge. Perhaps we should give instead of take",1,33
Asiago has been lying to me since the beginning,4,68
