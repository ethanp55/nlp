*soviet national anthem begins to play*,-1,-2
Asiago and Blue are looking for friends.  We could add them to our group for a mega-group,-1,-2
the only thing we have to lose is our chains brothers,-1,-2
We would be the strongest group,-1,-2
mega groups are harder to sustain and easier to betray,-1,-2
smaller group size is better imo,-1,-2
what do yall think?,-1,-2
3 together seems easier to sustain imo,-1,-2
OK.  Im sending you 6 each.  Also sending to my buddy Blue,-1,-2
"Im doing 5 this round, sending to blue and asiago too",-1,-2
Not to Asiago,-1,-2
im sending as many as I can for a total of 5 each,-1,-2

Ill give you three,-1,-2
cool same!,-1,-2
Im so dissappointed :(,-1,-2
can we still be friends?,-1,-2
Sending you 3 this round in return,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
"I may need some new friends, others are not treating me nice",-1,-2
"Im able to send you 2 this round.  Im friends with Blue, Cambert, Cottage.  Not sure how to integrate you in with us.",-1,-2
Let me see what I can do,-1,-2
"That is fine, dont worry too much",-1,-2
yo fellas,-1,-2
if we team up now well be unstoppable,-1,-2
"*hollow purple* nah, id win",-1,-2
"camembert, i gotta say youre a cool guy. Wanna be pals?",-1,-2
I am friends with cottage cheese and caprino. I think it would be fun to team up!,-1,-2
youre a real one,-1,-2
welcome aboard,-1,-2
Camembert is a part of the other group,-1,-2
hes giving them more tokens than he is to us,-1,-2
Hmm playing both sides,-1,-2
I wont give to him this round,-1,-2
Lets confront him in the chat and ask him to defend himself.,-1,-2
"sorry brie, Ill give you 5 this time",-1,-2
I totally misclicked,-1,-2
"All is forgiven, I am weak though",-1,-2
Just us now boys,-1,-2
five each,-1,-2
Im good with 5,-1,-2
should we try to recruit asiago?,-1,-2
"mozz just attacked, which begins the fall",-1,-2
Yeah asiago or caprino maybe?,-1,-2
caprino is pretty locked into that other group,-1,-2
Yeah asiago is probably the best best,-1,-2
*bet,-1,-2
lets take some points from taking down mazz,-1,-2
I talked to asiago,-1,-2
do we want to attack?,-1,-2
or just trade?,-1,-2
Next round attack?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
everything against mozz,-1,-2
but three for each of us,-1,-2
Im good with that for this round,-1,-2
Brie you in?,-1,-2
We attacking mozz?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
asaigo wants into our group,-1,-2
3 for us and rest from mozz,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
Lets let him in,-1,-2
awesome,-1,-2
We are still the weaker group we need to try to take out one of the big guys,-1,-2
this successfull attack with boost us up,-1,-2
"Yeah next round maybe, depending on how this goes?",-1,-2
gang gang,-1,-2
it is an honor to be in the presence of such cheese greatness,-1,-2
yall wanna team up?,-1,-2
Sending you each 5,-1,-2
sending each 6,-1,-2
Same^,-1,-2
sending 5 each,-1,-2
6? or 5?,-1,-2
"Ill do 6, why not",-1,-2
Ive trying to give a little to Mozzi,-1,-2
caprino there ar ethreats on your life,-1,-2
Do I drop em?,-1,-2
save a few tokens,-1,-2
asiago wants to take you don,-1,-2
^^^,-1,-2
i already defended you in the chat but he might try anyway ,-1,-2
asiago is anti caprino,-1,-2
Thanks for the heads up,-1,-2
we can get him sometime soon,-1,-2
yeah lets target him pretty quick here,-1,-2
no one touches this group and lives to tell the tale,-1,-2
he and I are on good terms but Ill stop sending after this round,-1,-2
team caprino,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
caprino all the way,-1,-2
Nobody attacked -- I saved some at the last moment,-1,-2
Sorry to not give you more,-1,-2
my OG homie,-1,-2
nice,-1,-2
all good,-1,-2
nah we are good to hear youre good,-1,-2
5 each this round from me,-1,-2
5 each from me as well,-1,-2
Same,-1,-2
start maybe saving a token or two we are strong and will likely get attacked soon,-1,-2
be on the lookout,-1,-2
We are the strongest group,-1,-2
we are the strongest group,-1,-2
hahaha,-1,-2
we are the STRONGEST group,-1,-2
"If one of us gets attacked, no worries.  We bring them back up later after eliminating the attackers",-1,-2
^^^,-1,-2
true,-1,-2
that is the plan,-1,-2
bet,-1,-2
asiago is a trouble maker,-1,-2
asiago sporadically sends me like 9 tokens,-1,-2
haha what??,-1,-2
Ive cut contact but thats why they gave me a bunch,-1,-2
hes tryign to make contact however possible,-1,-2
how many tokens this round?,-1,-2
9 tokens this round,-1,-2
Hmm ... they seem to be a societal outcast. What can we do?,-1,-2
i dont trust him so Im not sending back,-1,-2
one the one hand we can freind him,-1,-2
but he will drag us down,-1,-2
and he has advocated for violence in the main chats,-1,-2
idk how much I trust him,-1,-2
seems like hes out to cause chaos,-1,-2
indeed,-1,-2
chaotic evil is his alignment,-1,-2
true,-1,-2
more like chaotic chatoic,-1,-2
Aligned with the diablo?,-1,-2
6 to each of you this round,-1,-2
6 each my guys,-1,-2
lets hold out strong till the end,-1,-2
6 each <3,-1,-2
6 each,-1,-2
We are the strongest group,-1,-2
"shoot, actually i had to give to gouda last minute",-1,-2
he game me 4 last round. had to give him lvoe. my bad,-1,-2
you good thanks for the explanation,-1,-2
all good,-1,-2
whats the gameplan?,-1,-2
so like no one has started attacking,-1,-2
Same?,-1,-2
kinda worried. asiago sent 8 this round but im not sending back,-1,-2
you think he might turn and attaack instead?,-1,-2
he might.,-1,-2
asiago is desperate for freinds becauuse hes going down he might try to kick on the way down,-1,-2
maybe eveyrone do 5 each save 3 tokens just in case?,-1,-2
we have two options: eliminate the threat immediately or bring him in,-1,-2
5 to each,-1,-2
honestly I say eliminate before bring in,-1,-2
5 each and take 3 from him each?,-1,-2
5 each,-1,-2
Im undecided.. should we really attack?,-1,-2
he heanst attacked us yet so maybe not,-1,-2
oh dang haha,-1,-2
The other group attack em,-1,-2
looks ike someone attacked him,-1,-2
mozarella fell hard someone attacked him,-1,-2
"oh no, that was mozarella",-1,-2
"Wait, that was mozzi",-1,-2
they will prolly do one more round of attack on moz and then move to asiago,-1,-2
but idk,-1,-2
Lets attack the other group.  Mozzi wasnt bad,-1,-2
we dont have a clear target yet so Im doing 6 each,-1,-2
agreed,-1,-2
looks like other group is swiss and gouda,-1,-2
blue cheese sorry man we are trying to make you more popular,-1,-2
and brie,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
no worries! i am the grunt of the group,-1,-2
"yeah, it seems like that group is on good terms with asiago too",-1,-2
you already brought me up pretty high,-1,-2
They are a tight group.  The gained by attacking mozzi,-1,-2
the other group(s) arent very well organized,-1,-2
That one is,-1,-2
we coudl gain by attacking asiago,-1,-2
mimic their strategy,-1,-2
we could attak asiago and take him out,-1,-2
5 eahh and 3 on asiago,-1,-2
we want to? 3 steal each?,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
do you think that would make the other team turn on us?,-1,-2
"The threat is gouda, swiss, brie",-1,-2
done,-1,-2
asiago attacked,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
well that worked out strangely,-1,-2
attack didnt work,-1,-2
hey blue cheese welcome up,-1,-2
Did asiago block it by keeping?,-1,-2
"hmm, it looks like none were taken from asiago... didnt submit?",-1,-2
he must have blocked,-1,-2
what caused gouda and swiss to drop,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
i accidentally gave him 3 (asiago) instead of take i hit it too fast lol,-1,-2
thats on me,-1,-2
hahaha bruh,-1,-2
I bet brie kept,-1,-2
took this time lol,-1,-2
should we all attack brie?,-1,-2
hehee,-1,-2
gouda and swiss dropped by attacking mozzarella instead of giving to each other maybe,-1,-2
do we want to attack brie? do we feel like that team is oging to be a threat if left unchecked?,-1,-2
Lets attack Brie.  10 each,-1,-2
holy cow,-1,-2
10 each on brie?? ,-1,-2
10 each???,-1,-2

"Yo, violence is not the answer guys",-1,-2

"Asiago blocked, I felt threatened by them wanting to fight and being below them",-1,-2
dang really went rogue,-1,-2
cheese warfare getting out of hand,-1,-2
From the needs of the many to the needs of the few,-1,-2
They kept not trading back to me as well,-1,-2
everyone,-1,-2
we must fight mozzarella,-1,-2
its not a great cheese,-1,-2
"They are desperate, let us not judge. Perhaps we should give instead of take",-1,-2
Asiago has been lying to me since the beginning,-1,-2
I do apologize for my harsh actions,-1,-2
Would you like to be in our group of refined cheeses?,-1,-2
brie and swiss,-1,-2

"My dearest Alma,  Verily, I scribe unto thee with a heavy heart and a bruised countenance, for the memory of our recent skirmish weighs heavily upon my soul. Nay, I do not speak of the clash with our common foes, but of the grievous blow thou didst inflict upon me in the heat of battle.  Behold, as we stood side by side in the fray, our swords clashed with the enemy, and our valor was tested. Yet amidst the chaos and clamor of combat, thou didst unleash a mighty blow upon me, the force of which couldst rival the thunderous roar of a Nephite chariot.  Oh Alma, how couldst thou unleash such fury upon thy comrade? Didst thou mistake me for a Lamanite foe, or hath thine arm grown too strong for thy own good? Verily, I swear by the steel of my sword and the strength of my shield that never before hath I felt such a blow, save perhaps when Goliath fell before the sling of David.  Though the battle may have ended and the wounds may heal, the memory of thy potent strike shall linger like a stubborn stain upon the fabric of our fellowship. Yet, let it not be said that I bear thee ill will, for in the crucible of conflict, tempers may flare and swords may err.  Nevertheless, I beseech thee, Alma, to temper thy strength with mercy in future engagements, lest thy comrades find themselves nursing bruises as deep as the chasms of Helaman. Let us stand as brothers once more, united in purpose and undeterred by the scars of strife.  With sincerest regards, albeit with a sore body and wounded pride, Lemuel",-1,-2

"but they are soo high up, I think it would benefit us more if we went all out against them, but Im good to give 3",-1,-2
I agree with India,-1,-2
"Foxtrot doesnt really have any strong friends, so a coordinated attack would be effective",-1,-2

this is a default message,-1,-2
Is it possible?,-1,-2
I think it is,-1,-2
Im in,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
What are you recommending?,-1,-2
Im down to try,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
2 each and hold 2?,-1,-2
Not the most exciting game but can it be done,-1,-2
Do we get food? If we converge,-1,-2
No holding. 2 is up to your discretion,-1,-2
Dr. Crandall here: NO FOOD!!!,-1,-2
Give the extra two to the person directly below you in the rankings,-1,-2
This seems like communism,-1,-2
Well that was what I was going to do anyways.,-1,-2
It is. And it works if everyone cooperates.,-1,-2
But communism is good for everyone when we work together,-1,-2
apologies.  i ran out of time and kept everything,-1,-2
Sure Dr. Crandall,-1,-2
"Delta. We will try again with you but if you refuse the convergance, the convergance will refuse you",-1,-2
Dont let it happen again. Everyone do the same thing.,-1,-2
2 directly below?,-1,-2
Sacrifice your individualism for the machine. Send 4 to the same person you did last time. Who was delta supposed to give to,-1,-2
2 directly below actually,-1,-2
that will solve the problem,-1,-2
4 directly below excuse me,-1,-2
Im send 4 to golf.,-1,-2
4 to victor,-1,-2
I got 2 from everyone,-1,-2
4 to victor,-1,-2
okay nvm,-1,-2
who was above you last round mike,-1,-2
"Send 4 to the same person each time. 2 to everyone else. I got 4 from 2 people, someone messed up.",-1,-2
4 to oscar for me,-1,-2
Delta,-1,-2
Send 4 to the person below you again this time should be the last one. Delta is about to get blacklisted,-1,-2
Wait who was below me,-1,-2
Just send four to the person below you now,-1,-2
What a beautiful network graph,-1,-2
I feel bad for papa.  Im giving papa extra,-1,-2
It looks like were trying to summon a demon,-1,-2
No delta,-1,-2
We will converge,-1,-2
Dont give extra to anyone. We will converge with time. ,-1,-2
I only got 2 from everyone,-1,-2
I sent you 4 papa,-1,-2
jk,-1,-2
I sent golf 4,-1,-2
same -- i only got 2 from everyone.  people are cheating,-1,-2
Thou hast spoken Delta,-1,-2
Everyone say who your giving 4 to,-1,-2
arent we only supposed to give two?,-1,-2
I will give 4 to golf this round,-1,-2
My receives are correct. I get 4 from Echo and give 4 to Mike.,-1,-2
4 to papa,-1,-2
I got 4 and give 4 to Oscar,-1,-2
Wait. Are we giving to eachother papa?,-1,-2
Who has Golf?,-1,-2
This is too many to coordinate,-1,-2
"Yes, that is what happened last round. I assumed that was the pattern.",-1,-2
Give 4 to the person directly below you,-1,-2
It can be done. Next time we will reset and try again,-1,-2
We will reset who the person is next round if there is further confusion. It will be the person directly below you.,-1,-2
Comrad Mike: dont abandon it,-1,-2
agreed mike,-1,-2
Im confused,-1,-2
I got 4 from 2 people,-1,-2
Did you agree with them?,-1,-2
Starting this round: Always give 4 to the person directly underneath you. The player in last place will give to the first place player,-1,-2
I will always give 4 to echo,-1,-2
Ill give to Delta,-1,-2
I will always give to Mike,-1,-2
I will always give 4 to golf,-1,-2
Delta will always give me for,-1,-2
i will give four to victor,-1,-2
Delta ....,-1,-2
Mike->Echo->Papa->Delta->Oscar->Golf-Victor->Mike,-1,-2
Give 4 to who the arrow points to.,-1,-2
I think echo kept 2,-1,-2
Delta kept 2,-1,-2
See my new chat for details,-1,-2
im so lost,-1,-2
last time two of us gave to mike,-1,-2
so i assumed i did it wrong,-1,-2
I only got 4 from victor last round,-1,-2
Seems about right,-1,-2
Give the same as last time. We will fix the details next round without delta,-1,-2
Look up in the chat see who the arrows point to. Thats who you give to.,-1,-2
This isnt working. I think more people are confused than those who arent,-1,-2
Apparently arrows are too much for some people,-1,-2
which round was the arrows for?,-1,-2
It doesnt change with rounds.,-1,-2
"Once you have a set person, everyone maintains that same person.",-1,-2
SEE THE NEW CHAT SYSTEM,-1,-2
"Just saying, Oscar gave me 0 last round",-1,-2
Your a snake delta and a betrayer to the cause of convergance,-1,-2
Have you been giving 4 each round?,-1,-2
"Delta, have you been giving Oscar 4?",-1,-2
what if oscar is the lying?,-1,-2
Then I would not be in last ....,-1,-2
"True Oscar, we believe you. But we cant deviate from where we are without falling to chaos.",-1,-2
Deltas extra tokens are going to echo,-1,-2
"Delta, Papa, Echo, and Mike have split.",-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
We will converge without them,-1,-2
Possibly to poverty,-1,-2
giving you 4 if you want,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
right back atcha,-1,-2
whups.  I ran out of time,-1,-2
Giving you 4.  you can just give me 2 or less or whatever you want until I make amends,-1,-2
this is going to seem suspicious,-1,-2
Im supposed to give 4 to you,-1,-2
so not suspicious,-1,-2
you can do what you want,-1,-2
But Im your bestie,-1,-2
"okay, im going to give 2 directly below for a while",-1,-2
just so we dont get attacked from the get go,-1,-2
Im giving you 4,-1,-2
everyone is so confused,-1,-2
I think it is feigned confusion,-1,-2
maybe theyre figuring it out,-1,-2
im not sure what to do,-1,-2
Giving back to you this time.,-1,-2
"I know you are a shady character, but Ill trust you.",-1,-2
Thx,-1,-2
Should we do something interesting?,-1,-2
and buck the system?,-1,-2
"commrade, what are you suggesting?",-1,-2
"I dont know. If we do, we should make it clear our intentions so that they dont kill us.",-1,-2
"Or we can just let them kill us, and then sow chaos from the poverty line",-1,-2
Lets start with just verbal manipulation,-1,-2
What should we say?,-1,-2
Its pretty hard to buck the system without immediately appearing shady.,-1,-2
Just a little here and there,-1,-2
Just verbal for now though right? What kinds of things could we say?,-1,-2
not sure,-1,-2
just act confused?,-1,-2
There is a chat without you where they already want to drop you,-1,-2
I think we need to take larger action,-1,-2
What do you recommend?,-1,-2
Not sure,-1,-2
Maybe lets bring Echo into the group. Theyve been shady too,-1,-2
I dont trust Echo. But the bottom probably will focus on him. Why dont we just build each other up. Ignore Echo,-1,-2
Keep half and build half.,-1,-2
Im not sure yet.  Lets not be too clear about it,-1,-2
Delta is not cooperating,-1,-2
We must conerge without him,-1,-2
Are you sure? Delta also shot up,-1,-2
They kept for that reason,-1,-2
*Echo,-1,-2
i didnt keep,-1,-2
ill fix it this time,-1,-2
Delta is out,-1,-2
Give 3 to everyone and 2 to the person below you,-1,-2
Sending mike 2,-1,-2
"Wait Oscar, no one else has agreed yet. Maintain the old strategy for now.",-1,-2
I cant. I am getting no tokens from delta and he is supposed to give me 4,-1,-2
So youre the only one not being maintained?,-1,-2
im giving to papa,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
Would you like to form an alliance?,-1,-2
Yes!,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
3 to each?,-1,-2
play along with everyone this round,-1,-2
What do you suggest?,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
alright,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
Do we need to add a 4th individual?,-1,-2
Hmm idk,-1,-2
7 to each other this round?,-1,-2
i think well get attacked if we break off to soon,-1,-2
but we could?,-1,-2
Lets add papa and then break off,-1,-2
yeah i agree,-1,-2
add papa,-1,-2
Smaller groups are easier to coordinate.,-1,-2
What about staying together?,-1,-2
Lets add Mike,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
"Okay, new group.",-1,-2
Easier to coordinate in smaller groups,-1,-2
"okay okay, ignore the other chat",-1,-2
whats the plan,-1,-2
4 each?,-1,-2
"4 to each, then 2 to another person?",-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
done,-1,-2
deal,-1,-2
we better prepare to get attacked though,-1,-2
they wont be happy,-1,-2
Next round keep everything?,-1,-2
But we shouldnt keep it like that otherwise well leak,-1,-2
there are only 3 of them,-1,-2
"oh, its obvious.",-1,-2
Keep 10 tokens? Attack with 4?,-1,-2
Maybe not attack?,-1,-2
No attack.  Just 3 to each and keep the rest?,-1,-2
i agree with delta,-1,-2
Deltas plan,-1,-2
Done,-1,-2
though we cant do that forever,-1,-2
or well lose ground,-1,-2
Only if they are coordinated enough,-1,-2
Just this round and the next and then back to giving,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
i just got added to a group,-1,-2
Victor attacked,-1,-2
"oh, they attacked -- golf and oscar",-1,-2
they want to attack,-1,-2
theyre probably going to keep,-1,-2
what should we do?,-1,-2
should we keep,-1,-2
Just keep?,-1,-2
-2 to Oscar?,-1,-2
"No, lets hit one of them",-1,-2
-2 wont have an impact,-1,-2
Lets hit Oscar hard,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Maybe 2 of us?,-1,-2
The other two hit Victor,-1,-2
2 of you should be enough,-1,-2
ill do vic,-1,-2
should papa and i keep a little,-1,-2
everything on vic,-1,-2
before we get shot down,-1,-2
"no, we need to all attack",-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
sorry i ran out of time to do all,-1,-2
what now?,-1,-2
golf and oscar?,-1,-2
Ill hit golf,-1,-2
with echo?,-1,-2
You need to both hit Golf,-1,-2
Ill hit golf too,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Me and D on golf e and p on oscar?,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
oscar and victor are really threatening attack,-1,-2
just fyi,-1,-2
should we build eachother up?,-1,-2
Keep half and use the other half to build up each other.,-1,-2
Drop golf a bit more?,-1,-2
Ill take Golf since hes my level,-1,-2
Giving 4 each,-1,-2
Anyone else giving?,-1,-2
im giving 3,-1,-2
victor and oscar went after me last round (fyi),-1,-2
3 to each,-1,-2
"Im giving, but I feel very funerable.",-1,-2
Whats the plan,-1,-2
"Okay, this chat then. Ignore the New Group chat",-1,-2
"Nevermind, New group it is",-1,-2
Sending you each 7,-1,-2
Lets attack Delta with everything.,-1,-2
deak,-1,-2
"Sorry, I forgot to attack, then I attacked Mike.... ",-1,-2
All in on papa,-1,-2
Lets each attack Papa,-1,-2
This should be our main chat. Attack Papa!!!,-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
Mike and Echo both hit me with everything. Continue the attach on Mike now?,-1,-2
All in on mike yes,-1,-2
Kill Mike.,-1,-2
Kill Delta again,-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
He will be the target of all our attacks perpetually,-1,-2
We will pull them all down. Unless they kill the timer.,-1,-2
all 14 on delta,-1,-2
Hit delta with everything,-1,-2

echo. We need your leadership,-1,-2
"Echo, what do you want our small force to do?",-1,-2
Echo. We will crown you as king,-1,-2
You will be our leader,-1,-2

The cause is lost,-1,-2

We will leave you alone,-1,-2
Turn on Mike and well make you our king. Otherwise well pull you down with our poverty.,-1,-2
Hear hear,-1,-2
"Echo, well let you stay on top if you turn on Mike",-1,-2
Echo. My faith was misplaced,-1,-2
Im giving both some,-1,-2
both of you,-1,-2

Turn on Mike or delta and we wont come for you.,-1,-2
We know you wanted to be a cool kid papa but theyve already forgotten you,-1,-2

Im more worried about Echo,-1,-2
Echo is dependent on delta,-1,-2
Delta is acting as their shield.,-1,-2
Theyre linked with the blood of their fellow men,-1,-2

I will stop for now. It was a warning shot,-1,-2
Yea we can be cool,-1,-2
Youre on probation ,-1,-2
"Provi, Im good with you now",-1,-2
Mozz I thought you wouldnt attack?,-1,-2
You said youd give last round and didnt. It was sus,-1,-2
I did tho,-1,-2
"But now we can be homies, you have actually given for the first time",-1,-2
Just not to you to be fair,-1,-2
Thats my point dawg,-1,-2
but you attacked me first so,-1,-2
Friends?,-1,-2
im in,-1,-2
4 tokens?,-1,-2
Do you have anyone else?,-1,-2
colby and provolone,-1,-2
Lets start with 8? and well find other friends?,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
again?!?!,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
Why did you attack? ,-1,-2
Can I not count on you?,-1,-2
you can i am sorry,-1,-2
but i need a round cuz i am attacking this round,-1,-2
Give me some as well otherwise I will die. If you dont support me we fail,-1,-2
I am attacking Provolone,-1,-2
Ill join,-1,-2
Do the same,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
you want to attack queso this round?,-1,-2

Ill give you some,-1,-2
We could join together for victory,-1,-2
Would you be open to friendship?,-1,-2
hey thanks!,-1,-2
Ill give you 4,-1,-2
"thanks, ill give you 6!",-1,-2
"Attacking blue this round, so I wont be able to give to you",-1,-2
no worries! thanks ,-1,-2
"im attacking blue too, ill give more next round",-1,-2
"K, giving 4 this round",-1,-2
same ,-1,-2
hey blue cheese stole 16 from me,-1,-2
could you just steal from him instead of giving to me? ,-1,-2
Ill see if I can get my group to attack,-1,-2
thanks,-1,-2
if its okay Ill give more next round,-1,-2
Doing -8 on blue,-1,-2
thanks,-1,-2
"Colby, youre one of us now",-1,-2
Lets go,-1,-2
"Mozzarella, I meant to warn you that Blue Cheese was plotting against you, but I ran out of time.  Ill try to get more intel",-1,-2
Lets gett em,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Blue cheese has attacked,-1,-2
do we attack now?,-1,-2
I would be down,-1,-2
We all go up or down together,-1,-2
Lets maybe attack blue next round,-1,-2
Sounds good. Everyone in?,-1,-2
In,-1,-2
Lets each do -8 on blue and disperse evenly the rest ,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Again or no?,-1,-2
"I think I forgot to submit last round, Im so sorry",-1,-2
They will probably keep,-1,-2
"No worries, Colby",-1,-2
True. So normal trades? Keep some to be safe,-1,-2
Lets give to each other this round,-1,-2
"Yeah, keep a bit.",-1,-2
"Yes, submitted now",-1,-2
"4 to each and 4 to keep, maybe",-1,-2
4s all around the board,-1,-2
444,-1,-2
Queso has been super consistent with me,-1,-2
Raclette has with me as well,-1,-2
Queso does seem nice,-1,-2
could take em in,-1,-2
We can give 1 or 2 each there,-1,-2
The exchange rate is pretty high. Other thoughts?,-1,-2
We do need to keep our top positions to help each other though,-1,-2
I think we just use our 4 left over however we want,-1,-2
That works,-1,-2
Blue cheese is still stealing,-1,-2
Attack again?,-1,-2
Should we finish blue cheese off? or give em another chance with peaceful negotiations,-1,-2
Lets shred some cheese,-1,-2
Down. How much do we hit them with?,-1,-2
-8 again?,-1,-2
Lets do it,-1,-2
We might not need that much. how about -6 on em?,-1,-2
If theyre smart theyll be keeping,-1,-2
That worked,-1,-2
Perfect,-1,-2
Provolone sus,-1,-2
Sure is. ,-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
Did you receive anything last turn?,-1,-2
No,-1,-2
Me neither,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
Oh now I did. Oh well,-1,-2
I havent gotten anything from prov,-1,-2
Provi has been giving to me last 2 rounds.  What do we do?,-1,-2
Colby seems nice,-1,-2
They are still sus,-1,-2
Also giving to me,-1,-2
Same for colby,-1,-2
Me too,-1,-2
We can take them in,-1,-2
Lets drop prov and pick up colby,-1,-2
Yea,-1,-2
Blue cheese took everthing from me...,-1,-2
We should be friends,-1,-2
Ive 4 for you if you want em.  Would you exchange with me?,-1,-2
deal,-1,-2
Done,-1,-2
Again?,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
you want to team up and kill our enemies?,-1,-2

I was kinda scared man...,-1,-2
I was like what if you attacked me instead?,-1,-2
well do it this round,-1,-2
But this time Im all in I swear,-1,-2
"Wait, what do you want to do?",-1,-2
"Uh, that definitely hurt me",-1,-2
But I did it,-1,-2
well that was rude,-1,-2
you kept lying,-1,-2
what did you expect?,-1,-2
Bruh,-1,-2
"Once, because I was worried about you attacking me like you just did",-1,-2
and then I kept my word,-1,-2
Want to be friends with blue cheese with me?,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
Im sending tokens to you as an act of good faith,-1,-2
Sending back this round!,-1,-2
We should work together,-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
Please hit provolone. They attacked me.,-1,-2
"raclette, are you giving everything to blue cheese?",-1,-2
why are you at the bottom and theyre at the top?,-1,-2
I hadnt been,-1,-2
whys your relationship so strong then?,-1,-2
the gap is just widening,-1,-2
We both gave 8 to each other for the first few rounds,-1,-2
oh yeah,-1,-2
kinda looks like blue cheeses strat is to take down people one at a time,-1,-2
Looks like it.,-1,-2
trade?,-1,-2
You sus,-1,-2
why tho,-1,-2
Ive been giving you for a couple rounds,-1,-2
"Ill keep it up if you give me some back, otherwise Im out",-1,-2
I cant rely on Bleu Cheese... Can I join up with you? Colby should be able to vouch for me.,-1,-2
Sending it all to you three.,-1,-2
If you dont want to be friends could you at least let me know?,-1,-2
"Sorry, Raclette, just saw this now",-1,-2

Sending a few as well from over here,-1,-2
Giving you 3 Raclette,-1,-2
Thanks,-1,-2
I will send some too,-1,-2
"Raclette, giving you 3.  If you could give me 5 that would help me rise up too",-1,-2
I cant really help you rise up unless I am at your level. Your best bet is to push me up so that I can contribute.,-1,-2
Im helping with that as much as possible,-1,-2
"If you give me 5 and I give you 3, well both rise",-1,-2
Im giving you guys everything. Keep an eye on blue cheese.,-1,-2
Hes killing queso and provolone,-1,-2
Trying to hit blue cheese now so fewer tokens this round... sorry,-1,-2
Did I have positive impact on you Raclette?,-1,-2
You guys might have gone up. But I stayed the exact same. please give more.,-1,-2
check your report card to see what our impact  on you was,-1,-2
why would you call us poverty,-1,-2
i mean true but,-1,-2
#hurts,-1,-2
Cause Im poor,-1,-2
But anyway,-1,-2
Work together?,-1,-2
yeah sure,-1,-2
Provolone youre the reason I have problems.,-1,-2
???,-1,-2
You attacked me earlier at a vulnerable time.,-1,-2
I did?,-1,-2
Then I had no recourse but to retaliate.,-1,-2
Honestly do not remember that,-1,-2

yeah,-1,-2
you too?,-1,-2
no,-1,-2
should we go all in,-1,-2
i just saw on the chart.  what do you want to do?,-1,-2
or attack back,-1,-2
I think theres too many of them to fight back,-1,-2
they wanted me to be part of their group,-1,-2
im giving you 22,-1,-2
ok ill do the same,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
What just happened?,-1,-2
ok they all took 22 from me,-1,-2
all of them come for you?,-1,-2
oh my goodness,-1,-2
should we ask november to help?,-1,-2
defend yourself this turn and keep all your tokens,-1,-2
we can both give to you and you can keep,-1,-2
I thought there was a poverty line,-1,-2
im not sure,-1,-2
sounds like they forgot it,-1,-2
you should keep I think they will attack you this turn,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
ok game over I guess,-1,-2
haha,-1,-2
yeah pretty much,-1,-2
uhhhhh,-1,-2
sorry,-1,-2
I dont know what we should have done better,-1,-2
i dont know either,-1,-2
i think we just were too small of forces and theyre too big of a group,-1,-2
that is fair,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
im still giving to you even though its not worth anything,-1,-2
yeah sorry I lowered that time,-1,-2
i was trying to see if we could team up with november,-1,-2
even though it still wouldnt do much haha,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Should we both give all to november?,-1,-2
sounds good.,-1,-2
what is there to lose? haha,-1,-2
if we have negative token and steal from each other does that cancel out?,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
haha no idea,-1,-2
i guess itd be an interesting experiment,-1,-2
ya im stealing everything from you,-1,-2
you should do the same,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
looks like it made our situation worse?,-1,-2
it is kinda hard to tell,-1,-2
"Everyone, please welcome our newest member, Hotel.",-1,-2

We are merging groups so we will incorporate you next time,-1,-2

Round 14,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2

I am,-1,-2
i am,-1,-2
I am,-1,-2
it would be three tokens per person,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
A good way to begin.,-1,-2
okay with that,-1,-2
three to each?,-1,-2
Okay. I sent you all 3. ,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
I dont think quebec is interested in joining,-1,-2
yeah doesnt seem like it,-1,-2
"Lima / X-ray, if you dont give back, I dont hink I can trust you",-1,-2
Quebec are you not interested?,-1,-2
"Was it an accident, Quebec?",-1,-2
To hurt so many people like that...,-1,-2
yeah thats my bad oscar i couldnt find who the last person i was trying to give to,-1,-2
oh sorry oscar I missed you,-1,-2
Lets give everyon 4 but quebec,-1,-2
there arent enough tokens for that,-1,-2
Everyone give your extra tokens to Hotel. He needs some support.,-1,-2
Hmm. Well I currently have 4 for everyone except Oscar and hotel. But I think my ratio will balance that out,-1,-2
oscar ill give you my extras bc i messed up last time,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2
... I missed the timer,-1,-2
sorry,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
i missed it too,-1,-2
"I am not able to grow if I dont get a little extra. Please, I will quickly be left behind because Im the weakest. I dont want that fate.",-1,-2
It happens. Hotel you will grow with the group. ,-1,-2
"Im not giving to those who didnt submit this round, Ill give next round though.",-1,-2
same,-1,-2
I went down that round.,-1,-2
that is fair I agree with that,-1,-2
"X-ray, Im giving back to you now that I know I can trust you after the prior misstep",-1,-2
Zulu and Lima both forgot about poor Hotel.,-1,-2
Round 6,-1,-2
Hotel forgot about me,-1,-2
Shoot... This is such a big group...,-1,-2
quebec has teamed up with others,-1,-2
I can see that,-1,-2
Which others?,-1,-2
Can someone start a new chat without Quebec? The other group can see our secret intel.,-1,-2
yeah that would be the best,-1,-2
Namely that were all going to attack him.,-1,-2
Hotel. Youre going to be suspended by this group if you dont take a breather,-1,-2
Round 7,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2

ok this one is good i think,-1,-2
No you got us all,-1,-2
thanks!,-1,-2
Ill chill out. Sorry.,-1,-2
i dont have enough for four each did i mess something up?,-1,-2
"@lima, there arent enough for 4 each",-1,-2
yeah rest of tokens are just up to each of you,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
what happened to juliet?,-1,-2
Juliet just attacked Quebec,-1,-2
how Juliet can griw so fast?,-1,-2
oh and quebec fell,-1,-2
I am guessing Quebec gave everything.,-1,-2
Lets take juliett out,-1,-2
I think we should yeah,-1,-2
three to each and the rest to attack juliet?,-1,-2
Are we agreed to drop Juliett?,-1,-2
@lima that sounds perfect,-1,-2
"No, dont attack Juliet. Attack Quebec.",-1,-2
Yes I like that Lima. ,-1,-2
why quebec?,-1,-2
Quebec just gave to Juliett,-1,-2
Quebec is trying to get us to attack Juliett,-1,-2
Hes a bad actor,-1,-2
ok Im willing to attack quebec,-1,-2
So attack quebec?,-1,-2
I am not sure they have sustainable relationship if they have gave all to the juliett,-1,-2
3 to each and then 4 to attack quebec,-1,-2
I gave three each and 4 against quebec,-1,-2
Sounds good to me,-1,-2
20 second,-1,-2
left,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
"By dropping Quebec, we automatically drop Juliett as well since she depended on him",-1,-2
quebec went crazy this round,-1,-2
juliett must have also donated all,-1,-2
But it looked like he kept,-1,-2
Same strategy?,-1,-2
we might have to use more tokens to attack idk,-1,-2
Lets go all in on Juliett and quebec,-1,-2
"3 to each, but do we attack both? split the difference. 2 from each.",-1,-2
Half on each,-1,-2
They might be alternating keeping,-1,-2
I think it is better to attack one person first,-1,-2
"If so, if we choose wrong they will be protected.",-1,-2
Okay. All in on Jules,-1,-2
three to each and four to Jules?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
No. All on Jules,-1,-2
Juliett might be keeping this round. Quebec did last round,-1,-2
all?,-1,-2
all,-1,-2
I would split,-1,-2
ALL ON JULIETT,-1,-2
ALL ON JULES,-1,-2
I gave 2 to each of you which left 5 to attack both Juliett and Quebec.,-1,-2
If we dont things are going to get crazy,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
quebec?,-1,-2
next>,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
Yup. Then back to normal,-1,-2
I guess I never submitted...,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
lol hotel :),-1,-2
all on quebec or just some?,-1,-2
just all,-1,-2
All on quebec. End the fighting before it starts,-1,-2
that will make it simple,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
All if we want to make sure to overcome his keep,-1,-2
anyway we are gonna grow steadily when we take them down,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
back to normal?,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
ok yeah,-1,-2
Im giving the 4 tokens to those on the bottom,-1,-2
"Thanks, thats what Im doing too.",-1,-2
*Of our group,-1,-2
Im sticking with my proportionate giving,-1,-2
Unless the majority wants something else,-1,-2
That just means you give me less.,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Well you and I can stick with our current deal if youre fine with that?,-1,-2
Sure. Just means I can give 4 to everyone else.,-1,-2
K sounds good,-1,-2

I think it will be in our interest to stick together,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2

"Lets work with the group, but I will send you 6",-1,-2
Does that sound good?,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2

Sending 6,-1,-2
how about 5 to be less obvious,-1,-2
5 is good,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2

last round they jsut said,-1,-2
i like the look of this,-1,-2
us v them?,-1,-2
lets do it,-1,-2
we need some people in here who get good popularity to take down the others,-1,-2
so we may wanna pair up and trade with each other,-1,-2
This is where the fun begins,-1,-2
Ive given some to everyone,-1,-2
but we can pair,-1,-2
Im giving equally to everyone this round,-1,-2
are you in Quebec?,-1,-2

i am hitting someone else,-1,-2
IT DIDNT SUBMIT,-1,-2
Big sad,-1,-2
"delta, i am giving you 8, feel free to give me only like 4 so you gain pop",-1,-2
"Unless of course, it didnt submit",-1,-2
still hitting foxtrot?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
whats up,-1,-2
I think we need to form a pair you and I,-1,-2
i like this,-1,-2
"i can give you 5 if you give me 5, that way we make points",-1,-2
Sounds fair to me,-1,-2
Ill give you 6 this round if you match me,-1,-2
SORRY MAN ,-1,-2
nah give me 2 and ill give you 6 so you make more pop,-1,-2
since i screwed you last time,-1,-2
Very well,-1,-2
3 each way?,-1,-2
yessir,-1,-2
"You and I have enough weight that we should try to wipeout a lower tier player on the other team, and continue trading",-1,-2
Overtime,-1,-2
Lets do 4 each,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
How much this round?,-1,-2
3,-1,-2
we can do three between the two of us,-1,-2
How are you doing Papa,-1,-2
idk man,-1,-2
my head hurts,-1,-2
im gonna give you 4 this round,-1,-2
I feel that,-1,-2
Ill match,-1,-2
no worries man,-1,-2
i had that happen to me,-1,-2
ill still give you 4,-1,-2
Yeah sorry I judged you,-1,-2
Ill give you 5 this round,-1,-2
youre kind,-1,-2
feel free to save some to block,-1,-2
i can knock mine down to give you 2 if you wanna give me 3,-1,-2
Fine,-1,-2
Three and three?,-1,-2
"nw man im giving you 3, give me 2",-1,-2
i can give you pop,-1,-2
Very well,-1,-2
has anyone gotten anything from Que?,-1,-2
I have not,-1,-2
I dont trust them,-1,-2
I sense a plot to destroy the alliance. Theyre in cahoots iwth the other team,-1,-2
"sounds good, well use this chat then",-1,-2
i have gotten nothing from quebec,-1,-2
lets wreck him,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
"Im taking 4 from Quebec, and giving 4 to each of you",-1,-2
Im taking three from quebec,-1,-2
"so my pop will take a hit, alpha if you can bring us up ",-1,-2
cool,-1,-2
quebec and oscar are partners,-1,-2
"foxtrot hit me hard, my Quebec attack was not succesful",-1,-2
I think so^,-1,-2
i will give 3 to each of you,-1,-2
"same, are you still in Alpha?",-1,-2
we should all hit someone with a lot,-1,-2
try to succeed,-1,-2
Oscar quick,-1,-2
submitted,-1,-2
on oscar,-1,-2
yep,-1,-2
foxtrot hit me again,-1,-2
maybe we just trade a lot and try to boost popularity,-1,-2
i think the big guys are saving a lot,-1,-2
"if we hit someone, maybe we hit someone smaller",-1,-2
"yeah, like foxtrot",-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
^^ i like that. i will give each of you 5 and use the rest to hit foxtrot,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
submitted,-1,-2
what do you think happens if we get foxtrot to join us?,-1,-2
Why would they?,-1,-2
"they are isolated, look at the map, they dont have anyone close to their dot. WOuld our points change if we repair a relationship?",-1,-2
Everyone steal 2 from quebec,-1,-2
but what if they block?,-1,-2
"Valid consideration. However, they keep getting stronger",-1,-2
lets say quebec and oscar are just trading with each other and then saving to block,-1,-2
we need to figure out a way to break that,-1,-2
I know they are. They invited me to join them in a trifecta,-1,-2
we di the same until we rise and have more value in our points?,-1,-2
we have a trifecta already,-1,-2
gave four each,-1,-2
we are rising,-1,-2
lets do four each again,-1,-2
Im down,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
four each again,-1,-2
rest goes against quebec,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
Quebec is falling,-1,-2
"ill give each of you 3, dont give me any",-1,-2
ill boost yall up,-1,-2
"okay, thanks",-1,-2
Papa I couldnt help but notice you didnt trade last round,-1,-2
i messed up,-1,-2
but lemme fix it by giving you some,-1,-2
Ill give you a four for four Alpha,-1,-2
Im game Delta,-1,-2
it may pay more if the most popular one gives tokens to others,-1,-2
true,-1,-2
"okay alpha, do we use your position to attack or rise?",-1,-2
I say lets trade 3 each way among us this round,-1,-2
i will do that,-1,-2
deal,-1,-2
attack next round?,-1,-2
lets attack next round,-1,-2
you have a pretty good relationship with Oscar Alpha...,-1,-2
you have no negative points with any of the big two,-1,-2
That is correct. He and I are working taking down Quebec,-1,-2
Hes not doing a good job,-1,-2
What do you think is more likely to succeed?,-1,-2
me?,-1,-2
ive hit oscar and quebec each,-1,-2
yo alpha what,-1,-2
I didnt hit submit,-1,-2
RIP,-1,-2
thats an oof,-1,-2
Ill give yall one extra than last round,-1,-2
"okay, four each them",-1,-2

"alpha, whats your deal with oscar man",-1,-2
hes gonna screw you at some point for points,-1,-2
Im aware,-1,-2
We stopped with him turns ago,-1,-2
"alright, alright",-1,-2
three each?,-1,-2
ill do that,-1,-2
"alpha, youre on top now",-1,-2
how much you gonna give us? and well give you just under,-1,-2
Ill give you and delta each 4 this round,-1,-2
i see you gave me some so ill give you 2 this round,-1,-2
we can start something good on the backend,-1,-2
sounds good to me,-1,-2
"sorry, i didnt see this. this round i gotchu though",-1,-2

romeo and foxtrot came after me,-1,-2
Quebec stole from me. Were done.,-1,-2
"Quebec, dont trade as much with us.. they are attacking the top player. Keep more to protect",-1,-2
"fam, it is not profitable to hit you anymore",-1,-2
"if you dont hit me, i wont hit you",-1,-2
"instead, we have oscar on top",-1,-2
im tapped out on hitting ya,-1,-2
good man,-1,-2
me and you togetha brotha,-1,-2

i wanna save to hit quebec or oscar tho,-1,-2

Fine by me,-1,-2
Lets trade 4 this round. We are rising,-1,-2

I didnt hit submit. Everyone is mad at me. My bad,-1,-2
"Ill give you 4 this round, and you dont have to pay me",-1,-2
Do you want to resume trading?,-1,-2
"Yead, do 3",-1,-2
Great,-1,-2
yall i think quebec and oscar are trading with each other and then blocking the rest,-1,-2
we all need to crush them,-1,-2
"This is happening, Im a witness. everyone steal 2 from quebec",-1,-2
what is the last round? i say we all take them for everything theyre worth final round,-1,-2
i think this is it,-1,-2
all hit quebec and oscar,-1,-2
"if we bring one down, the other falls with them",-1,-2
Quebec is strongest,-1,-2
so should we focus on quebec then,-1,-2
all crush him,-1,-2
done,-1,-2
screw oscar,-1,-2
"yall, oscar and quebec are still on top",-1,-2
"romeo, whats up man",-1,-2
what did i do to piss alpha off,-1,-2
its about to rough in this after the game ends,-1,-2
yo oscar and quebec trying to make deals and then not giving you any so they make money,-1,-2
it just happened to me,-1,-2
and oscar shot up,-1,-2
im about to pop off on oscar,-1,-2
everyone take four?,-1,-2
From Oscar? Might jsut lose points,-1,-2
if everyone attacked?,-1,-2
"Hey, you keep giving me tokens",-1,-2
"you want to get boosted? If i trade with you, you can get higher",-1,-2
join the top of the leaderboard,-1,-2
Im down,-1,-2
Ill give you 2 for 2,-1,-2
sounds good to me,-1,-2
lets both do 3 this round,-1,-2
Try to boost you up,-1,-2

big papa,-1,-2

ill give you 3 for 3,-1,-2
"2 is the most i can do, I got people head hunting.. i need to protect",-1,-2
thats fine,-1,-2
oof my man,-1,-2
"Alpha is on the top now, and hasnt traded with me",-1,-2
did he trade with you?,-1,-2
"no, he didn",-1,-2
he ate 4 of mine,-1,-2
we could bait him,-1,-2
say well trade with all of us,-1,-2
but dont give any to him,-1,-2
feign not submitting,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
his relationship is as good as ours with Oscar,-1,-2
thats probably why he has more than us,-1,-2
ill give you 4 this round,-1,-2
"Oscar pulls him up, he pulls us up?",-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
that could work,-1,-2
alpha was true with me last round,-1,-2
its possible we may need to cut ties to make this work,-1,-2
romeo has been hitting alpha,-1,-2
we could ally with him and hit alpha to bump us up,-1,-2
especially since alpha is working with oscar,-1,-2
"strange, so has foxtrot",-1,-2
true,-1,-2
Romeo hasnt said anything,-1,-2
ill give you 5,-1,-2
we need to keep trading at least,-1,-2
deal,-1,-2
alpha hasnt given me anything for 3 rounds,-1,-2
im not giving him any then,-1,-2
he is not to be trusted,-1,-2
did he open a private chat with you?,-1,-2
"Ill give you 4, you give me 2",-1,-2
Ill boost you up,-1,-2
you havent traded with me for 3 rounds,-1,-2
"Very true, Ive been attacking Romeo with all my points",-1,-2
I apologize,-1,-2
Would you prefer not to trade at all?,-1,-2
that works,-1,-2
Which way? Trade or not trade?,-1,-2
is alpha still attacking you?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
you need some help beating oscar,-1,-2
cut me in,-1,-2
ill give you 2,-1,-2

"Mike was kind to you Yankee, are you talking with them?",-1,-2
one of them gave me 8,-1,-2
i didnt give them any tho,-1,-2
or i gave them 1,-1,-2
"We can see if they want to join, but they also gave half to Tango.",-1,-2
as long as we are giving each other 5. we are safe.,-1,-2
golf and tango asked me if they can join,-1,-2
i feel like thats too big,-1,-2
"I agree, too big. Lets hold off for now.",-1,-2
Round 3,-1,-2
they are 4 and we are 4,-1,-2
"Maybe we each reach out to Mike, it seems they are being left behind",-1,-2
I am pretty sure they have teamed up with mike already,-1,-2
Maybe Yankee can sway them?,-1,-2
Looks like we got two groups. WHos gonna attack first?,-1,-2
what should we do then? try to woo over mike?,-1,-2
we need to attack first,-1,-2
before they attack,-1,-2
that is only way to survive,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
ok we attack this round?,-1,-2
Attack this round?,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2

predictible,-1,-2
"Lets hit Tango then. They havent been attacking, so they wont see it coming.",-1,-2

mike ,-1,-2
"If you could give some to me while Im attacking, it would help.",-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
Giving 3 to each and using the rest to attack make and Tango,-1,-2
*mike and tango,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
that is good idead,-1,-2
Miek and tango are below poverty,-1,-2
I wouldnt attack,-1,-2
attack,-1,-2
golf?,-1,-2
would be better,-1,-2
I think,-1,-2
Go thinking.,-1,-2
Pretty sure golf is keeping,-1,-2
but we need to take him down somehow,-1,-2
Im still attacking golf,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
we should attack all tofether,-1,-2
if we want to take him down,-1,-2
Or do we grow eachother for a round?,-1,-2
I gave 3 to each and 7 from Golf,-1,-2
Hold up Yankee were you friends with golf?,-1,-2

Round 11,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
i thought we had chemistry,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
I will forgive you,-1,-2
I havent forgotten you,-1,-2
why would i believe you?,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2

Hi everyone,-1,-2
I think we should work together,-1,-2
Im fine with that,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
ill go 5 each,-1,-2
Sending you each 5,-1,-2
Round 3,-1,-2
5 again,-1,-2
"Good coordination. Im giving 5 again. However, if we dont act before the other group, they are likely to push us to poverty. That could be interesting to attack them from poverty, but I dont really want to risk it. As much as I dont want the inevitable it likely will happen.",-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
I agree. This round we should strike. I tried to make peace with them but they preferred to stay as seperate groups,-1,-2
I like yankee though. ,-1,-2
So if we act lets not go after him,-1,-2
who do we hit?,-1,-2
Uniform is the least connected to us,-1,-2
Im fine with splitting tokens negatively on all but Yankee,-1,-2
Lets go all on Uniform,-1,-2
yeah lets take one down at a time,-1,-2
Dont hit any one person too much or you wont get the benefit.,-1,-2
You only get up to the poverty line benefit,-1,-2
Fair. Split between uniform and zulu. ,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2
"well that was fortunate, my ui glitched so I couldnt submit",-1,-2
but they all attacked me,-1,-2
Do we attack Yankee for dropping our friend or get the other people out of the way first?,-1,-2
Lets go for Zulu next,-1,-2
I told yankee I was vouching for him so that should confuse them,-1,-2
Do we protect with any tokens?,-1,-2
No. Lets just agree to build up anyone lost in the fight,-1,-2
Zulu Next,-1,-2
Hope this works,-1,-2
Round 6,-1,-2
Round 6,-1,-2
"Yikes, I should have protected.",-1,-2
victor next?,-1,-2
Yep,-1,-2
Yankee is still a bad dude. Protect yourself Golf,-1,-2
Hell try to get you out from the top popularity,-1,-2
Round 7,-1,-2
You just keep protecting yourself Gold. Well try to make a bigger separation between yourself and the others so you can bring us back.,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
"Golf, can you start bringing some of your strongest supporters back to where they can help you more",-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
"Golf, it seems you have forgotten us. Please respond or we will.",-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2

Round 3,-1,-2

"Im sorry, right now I dont think thats the best for me",-1,-2
Sounds good. Hopefully we can work together down the road,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2

Lets pair up right now and we will be set,-1,-2
Just hold your tokens this round,-1,-2
ok Im doing that fs,-1,-2
and yes im down,-1,-2
Ill send you 4 this round,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
they arent going for u btw,-1,-2
Round 7,-1,-2
Lets go all in together. Thoughts?,-1,-2
should we bring in one more?,-1,-2
I dont think so. Maybe uniform?,-1,-2
no one else is prob much of a threat,-1,-2
Lets just do all in then and we will sore up and we can take on anyone,-1,-2
ok im doing that,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
mike went for me but whatever,-1,-2
Do you want to respond?,-1,-2
ill steal 4 from him maybe,-1,-2
but the rest to you,-1,-2
Okay. Sending 12 to you as well,-1,-2
stop they might attack you,-1,-2
watch out,-1,-2
keep like 6,-1,-2
Im holding all,-1,-2
Keep the rest of yours,-1,-2
shoot too late,-1,-2
thats fine,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
ok id appreciate a lot this round lol,-1,-2
What do we do now,-1,-2
Yeah for sure,-1,-2
"You keep 12, Ill give you 7 and hold the rest",-1,-2
So give me 4,-1,-2
That way we stay protected,-1,-2
Do we bring in Uniform?,-1,-2
i think so,-1,-2
and just get rid of our old group,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
I took uniform out ,-1,-2
ok that was kinda sketch ngl,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
I never attacked you ,-1,-2
yea i appreciate it,-1,-2
but you know i had to,-1,-2
So technically my peace chat ,-1,-2
hahaha yeah,-1,-2
The biggest problem was when you werent able to change your token selection when I was keeping,-1,-2
At that point I was miles above everyone,-1,-2
I dont trust golf,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
"Sure, I dont either. But if he doesnt bring us back up, we can get everyone else in the game to gang up on him.",-1,-2
Lets ask him to start giving to his friends.,-1,-2
"agreed, just wanted to air that",-1,-2
it looks like golf and yankee are forming a team,-1,-2
Yankee and Golf are working together.,-1,-2
Just saw the same thing. Lets take them down one at a time with everyone else,-1,-2
we might want to build ourselves up independently first a bit,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
wanna go 8 and 8 for a couple of rounds?,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
I should have acted against Golf sooner,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
"Golf and Yankee formed a team, then G attacked Yankee",-1,-2
What do we do?,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
okay ,-1,-2
Everyone should attack Golf with everything this round.,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
!,-1,-2
everyone agree?,-1,-2
"No, if he is smart he will just keep half his tokens the rest of the game to protect. That should be enough.",-1,-2
Everyone needs to join in for it to have an effect.,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
"lets all give each other 3 this round, then attack later",-1,-2
We should build ourselves up simultaneously.,-1,-2
it is not possible ,-1,-2
they are too big,-1,-2
then we should not attack,-1,-2
at al;l,-1,-2
While taking down Yankee we should build each other up.,-1,-2
Then we will be powerful enough to take on Golf,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
I gave to each of you.,-1,-2
attacked yankee,-1,-2
I attacked yankee,-1,-2
Uniform what happend?,-1,-2
I got attacked by golf,-1,-2
With everything,-1,-2
that is why,-1,-2
we should attack,-1,-2
all at once,-1,-2
Now?,-1,-2
take down yankee first,-1,-2
I think,-1,-2
then golf,-1,-2
will lose,-1,-2
firend,-1,-2
Golf is a bigger threat,-1,-2
but,-1,-2
we donot have enough power,-1,-2
i feel,-1,-2
lie,-1,-2
Im giving to you this round.,-1,-2
like,-1,-2
"hold on, yankee might not be happy with golf",-1,-2
also golf is mostly supporting themself,-1,-2
true,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
yanke could be turned,-1,-2
they still have strong relationship,-1,-2
though ,-1,-2
"If everyone attacked golf with everything, would it have an effect?",-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
lets just attack,-1,-2
whoever,-1,-2
"yes, if we can get yankee",-1,-2
golf,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
good?,-1,-2
let yankee know,-1,-2
Yankees in,-1,-2
so they go all in,-1,-2
"all on golf, no giving just war",-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Yankee,-1,-2
did not attack,-1,-2
golf,-1,-2
so,-1,-2
"yes they did, their bar got significantly smaller",-1,-2
everyone attack again! submit quickly to pull them down before game end.,-1,-2
I feel like golf is gonna keep the tokens and distract us to attack ,-1,-2
"yeah, yankee went all in on golf",-1,-2
golf,-1,-2
so that we can wast our ,-1,-2
tokens,-1,-2
that is what i fell,-1,-2
I think Golf will just keep waiting the rounds out and not submitting.,-1,-2
if yankee attacked golf,-1,-2
golf has gone down,-1,-2
golf will keep but if we all attack they keep falling,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
yankee is not attacking,-1,-2
we can see that,-1,-2
sorry,-1,-2
miss typed,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
It looks like golf isnt a great friend?,-1,-2
I think we should team with him actulaly,-1,-2
no one else would be able to stop us if we all worked together,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Golf is sketchy,-1,-2
yeah that was seriously sketch,-1,-2
should we attack golf?,-1,-2
not this round,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
I think this is our best chance and making it a full 30 min,-1,-2
I agree,-1,-2
Whats the plan,-1,-2
Let bye gones be bye gones,-1,-2
give 5 to each other then keep 6 just in case?,-1,-2
thats what im doing,-1,-2
Deal,-1,-2
Yeah sure,-1,-2
"Everyone is planning on attacking golf, but not this round",-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Sorry Uniform,-1,-2

"It might have an effect, but it would take a long time",-1,-2
I am too,-1,-2
"lets all go in,",-1,-2
death to the betrayer,-1,-2
ok lets go for it,-1,-2
"Fine, Ill go for it",-1,-2

yep,-1,-2
yep,-1,-2
Yep,-1,-2
Golf is killing the timer,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
ok this has to be last round most likely,-1,-2
Why did you not attack Yankee?,-1,-2
i did,-1,-2
i just had such a positive connection with him before,-1,-2
"No that positive dropped last time, but not this time.",-1,-2
"Whether or not Yankee did, the best option is still to go all in on golf",-1,-2
golf is too big to attack,-1,-2
take down yankee,-1,-2
hol up,-1,-2
Still attack golf,-1,-2
lets not do that,-1,-2
not yankee,-1,-2
golf is falling fast,-1,-2

Yea,-1,-2
I may have angered Gadianton,-1,-2
Not hard to do,-1,-2
True. Thats just scriptural,-1,-2
"Woah King benjamin, why no tokens?",-1,-2
"If we are gonna be good, we gotta be good",-1,-2
Why the backstabbing among the righteous?,-1,-2
sorry I repenteh,-1,-2
repenteth,-1,-2
Laman and Gadianton gave to me.  I fear their vengence,-1,-2
because I just wanna be with the good guys,-1,-2
Okay we all good now?,-1,-2
Repentance is wonderful,-1,-2
Laman and Gadianton gave two each to me,-1,-2
Dont let them sway you. The way of the world is not the way of Christ,-1,-2
Tryin to turn ya to the bad side?,-1,-2
should we give back?,-1,-2
Reach out to the lost sheep?,-1,-2
I could give one back to each of them or ignore,-1,-2
King Benjamin?  You returning to your evil ways?,-1,-2
Whats up with only one token Benji??,-1,-2
He does seem to be,-1,-2
Repentance is a process,-1,-2
I be better this time,-1,-2
"Benji, you gotta show your repentance before we can have you among the righteous",-1,-2
I also gave to laman and gadianton,-1,-2
yo,-1,-2
??,-1,-2
Yo yo,-1,-2
Hello,-1,-2
Yo laman and lemuel ,-1,-2
King Ben attacked,-1,-2
Lets kill King Benjamin in a few rounds? Now we should strengthen each other.,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
7 to each?,-1,-2
yuh im down,-1,-2
Brother of jared gave to me too,-1,-2
same ,-1,-2
Should we adopt him?,-1,-2
maybe keep the friendship with him,-1,-2
"He gave me 2, but a team of 3 is more stable in a game of this size, I think.",-1,-2
6 to each other and 2 to bro of jared?,-1,-2
yeah im down,-1,-2
yee,-1,-2
He gave nothing this round. I think it best if we focus on us three.,-1,-2
Okay he might be part of the other group now,-1,-2
yeah ,-1,-2
but do we kill benji now or later,-1,-2
7 to each?,-1,-2
I say we do 7 this round and kill next,-1,-2
I agree.,-1,-2
down,-1,-2
"Okay, hit Ben with everything?",-1,-2
Or is that too much?,-1,-2
im only worried bc hes already got a thing going with lamoni and the jareds,-1,-2
but idk,-1,-2
if we dont do it now itll look sus,-1,-2
Hit king ben with everything,-1,-2
We take him now or hell take us,-1,-2
yup,-1,-2
what do we do now,-1,-2
do we kill everyone?,-1,-2
we lowkey powerful,-1,-2
guys,-1,-2
what do we do,-1,-2
We need to be careful,-1,-2
They might keep,-1,-2
keep everything?,-1,-2
Now we give to each other but keep some?,-1,-2
keep half?,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
5 to each other and keep the rest.,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
We are about the same level as the others,-1,-2
im scared haha,-1,-2
0.o,-1,-2
Currently we are tied with their power. ,-1,-2
everyone took out on me,-1,-2
Alright we attack now,-1,-2
who,-1,-2
??,-1,-2
Jared,-1,-2
the good thing is Im not completly dead,-1,-2
Take out the top first,-1,-2
do I give everything or do I keep?,-1,-2
Lets hit Jared. Dont keep. We should have stayed offensive.,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
"Steal, they probably wont attack you",-1,-2
coulda shoulda woulda,-1,-2
yeah okay,-1,-2
"Wait, hit Lemuel. Less likely to block.",-1,-2
Excuse me?,-1,-2
i dont understand,-1,-2
"Sorry, King Lamoni... Im an idiot. Keep it at Jared. I thought they had the top two places.",-1,-2
lemuel is up nex,-1,-2
t,-1,-2
Yeah. I guess we should just finish off Jared? They will finish the rest of us off.,-1,-2
haha okay,-1,-2
"Lemuel, youre the only one with skin still in the game, what do you think?",-1,-2
we could give everything to you?,-1,-2
Im going to keep,-1,-2
idk how much it would help,-1,-2
Well give everything to Lemuel.,-1,-2
yeah well give,-1,-2
at least i will ,-1,-2
I think were gonners,-1,-2
For sure. ,-1,-2
wickedness never was happiness,-1,-2
I cant do anything.,-1,-2
"Well, Im dead",-1,-2
Glad to fight by your side,-1,-2
You brought me back. Im giving 7 to each. Hopefully they leave us be.,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
lets see if we can find joy in the humility of poverty,-1,-2
We can try to cause chaos in the other group,-1,-2
how,-1,-2
No clue,-1,-2
Making King Benjamin feel left out?,-1,-2
Do we need to exclude Ben?,-1,-2
He went against the plan...hate to see it,-1,-2
Im slated to give him 2,-1,-2
"Maybe, but we need em",-1,-2
All good now?,-1,-2
True. All is good,-1,-2
Benji is sketchy,-1,-2
Yea,-1,-2
Hes out,-1,-2
Not giving to him no more unless he brings forth much fruit meet for repentance,-1,-2
Amen.,-1,-2
Should we do 5 each to continue growing together?,-1,-2
Im good to give 5,-1,-2
Giving you both 6 -- Im good with you given me 5,-1,-2
Ill do 6 as well,-1,-2
Me too,-1,-2
I fear an attack from the wicked,-1,-2
"Jared, I think they are going to attack you",-1,-2
Do we defend or attack,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
That seems likely. I will do 5 with you guys and keep to prep,-1,-2
We have to coordinate together,-1,-2
Thats not enough,-1,-2
Lamoni should we attack one of them?,-1,-2
Or should I keep more. I will do as you comandeth,-1,-2
"If they attack, you are gone",-1,-2
"Yes, lets attack Gadianton",-1,-2
All tokens?,-1,-2
Yes.  All,-1,-2
Beautiful,-1,-2
All,-1,-2
God smites the wicked,-1,-2
Laman?,-1,-2
Yep,-1,-2
Sure. All again?,-1,-2
Yea,-1,-2
"Yes, all.  Do we have a truce that we will raise up whoever gets attacked by them.  We can all win together",-1,-2
"Yea, thats a good idea",-1,-2
"If one of us gets attack, we finish off the bad guys then resurrect our dead",-1,-2
Yup. One of us is for sure getting targeted this round,-1,-2
Probably me or Lamoni,-1,-2
We take out Laman,-1,-2
We should go for Lemuel soon,-1,-2
Laman first,-1,-2
Yup Im stealing all 14 from Laman this round to confirm,-1,-2
I got hit,-1,-2
"Lets get Lemuel, hes the only threat left",-1,-2
"No worries, Jared.  We got you.  This round we all take out Lemuel.  Next round, we resurrect each other",-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Jinx,-1,-2
We always did have that connection brother,-1,-2
Hit him again or what?,-1,-2
"Yes, hit him again",-1,-2
Great,-1,-2
"If you have any to spare, the closer I am to you the more we can help each other",-1,-2
I could steal 10 from him and give 4? Or some combo,-1,-2
Lets remove Lemuel first. Then we bring you back,-1,-2
All 14 going to lemuel then,-1,-2
"Im stealing all in, but he is much lower than you guys. Whatever you think is best",-1,-2
I am but a humble servent,-1,-2
Now Im giving you 6 each,-1,-2
Nicely done. We may have had some slight overkill,-1,-2
Sounds good to me brethren,-1,-2
Amen and amen,-1,-2
"There is temptation, even among the rightesou, to be greatest.",-1,-2
"Truly, we must forgo the temptation",-1,-2
I will hold firm,-1,-2
"Yes. Many are called, but few are chosen",-1,-2
We must keep our first estate,-1,-2
Lest we be cast into hell,-1,-2
Should I give any to Benjamin?,-1,-2
"No, I dont trust him",-1,-2
Understood,-1,-2
"You can if youd like, but I dont think he would be trustworthy",-1,-2
I did give him 1 last round.  Should I not?,-1,-2
It is given to men to choose for themselve,-1,-2
Amen,-1,-2
"Well said, Rabbi",-1,-2
Hear me out guy,-1,-2
What if we team up?,-1,-2
Um ... no,-1,-2
Lamoni was so converted he never fell away,-1,-2
Team up on Gadianton?,-1,-2
sounds like something gadianton would do,-1,-2
Shoot you right,-1,-2
"Jared I think we need to team up, being relatives and all",-1,-2
True that. Brother,-1,-2
Friendship,-1,-2
Charity,-1,-2
Pure Love of CHRIST,-1,-2
King benjamin hit me with 4.,-1,-2
yo pure love of Christ seeketh not her own,-1,-2
why would you steal from me and say that king benji,-1,-2
??,-1,-2
king benji hit me with a -4 too,-1,-2
King benjamin been real quiet in here,-1,-2
Is it too late for repentance?,-1,-2
"No, it is never too late. But you may have lost your first estate",-1,-2
Hmm... Can you check again?,-1,-2
"if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow",-1,-2
Checking ... nope. lost,-1,-2
Shoot.,-1,-2
"Being resurrected with 1... Yep, this doesnt feel Celestial...",-1,-2
I didnt choose the sinner life. The sinner life chose me.,-1,-2
it was always your choice.... 2 nephi 2:27,-1,-2

im taking two from uni just cos its how many i had left,-1,-2
take from delta they have less connections,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
if they come after me im gonna crash so fast ahaha,-1,-2
yep,-1,-2

real question though who is india? theyre pretty much dead,-1,-2
ive got no clue,-1,-2
were like theyre only two option tho,-1,-2
their*,-1,-2
"yeah, no one else is going to bring them back",-1,-2
do we still do that tho?,-1,-2
keep bringing them back?,-1,-2
I dont know.  this feels like an ethics class. we cant bring them back and theyll only lower us so what do we do?? their still a friend though ,-1,-2
im going to die in a second. delta just took some from me and that is going to actually kill me so fast,-1,-2
NOOOOO,-1,-2

romeos being a butt,-1,-2
fr though,-1,-2
hes asked three of us to be his juliet,-1,-2
hahaha,-1,-2
including me lol,-1,-2
delta just said that they offered me an olive branch as like a threat. pretty crappy branch. several rounds of me taking. they give me one. I give them two. then they take two. what kind of olive branch is that?!,-1,-2
youre my juliet. back of romeo,-1,-2
freaking delta,-1,-2
aww wait,-1,-2

honestly. better for you to let me be dead. use your tokens to live,-1,-2
i cant do that,-1,-2
this feels like the door scene in the titanic,-1,-2

Ill never let go alpha,-1,-2
like a jacob 5 olive branch,-1,-2

"Im in, but only if Delt stops stealing from me",-1,-2
Delta?,-1,-2

we need to do it together,-1,-2
ur mom,-1,-2
Kilo?,-1,-2
that would be rude,-1,-2
romeo,-1,-2
what about india?,-1,-2
Yea but i think wed get some good points,-1,-2
I say india,-1,-2
i vote romeo,-1,-2
Romeo is too high rank,-1,-2
yeah exactly,-1,-2
that will boost us a ton,-1,-2
Woah Delta whats up,-1,-2
why all the negative tokens,-1,-2
k lets jsut go with india and then we can pick another target later when they die,-1,-2
wait quebec you didnt give me any,-1,-2
i dropped a bunch,-1,-2
"i forgot to submit, sorry!!",-1,-2
ok cool no worries,-1,-2
"Ok india got wrecked, lets choose someone else",-1,-2

lets just kill india,-1,-2
brutal,-1,-2
if the others are in that works,-1,-2
all is fair in love and war,-1,-2
Ok quebec and charlie im gonna give yall a lot,-1,-2
I think that gives big points,-1,-2
do we take from india again or go for someone else?,-1,-2
"Im still taking some, not as much though",-1,-2
it works best I think if you just take a lot though all together and then they die,-1,-2
should i take a bunch then?,-1,-2
lets do that next time,-1,-2
ok sounds good,-1,-2
"Im gonna give yall 8 again, and take from india",-1,-2
Ok im gonna give you like 6 cause i want to target someone with more tokens,-1,-2
India again?,-1,-2
one more round of taking from India and then we can switch to a new target,-1,-2
ok sweet,-1,-2
Ok yall wanna go for kilo?,-1,-2

"I got a bunch of points last round, i think its cause we wrecked india",-1,-2
Maybe target x ray this time?,-1,-2

Uniform and Delta,-1,-2

what are we britain? taking down india like that?,-1,-2
oh my,-1,-2

bc,-1,-2
i,-1,-2

women,-1,-2
and during womens history month??,-1,-2
what up gang,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
we are the most nasty foods,-1,-2
therefore we need to unite,-1,-2
Excellent,-1,-2
6 to each?,-1,-2
can I get confirmation?,-1,-2
6,-1,-2
6,-1,-2
looks like they did the exact same thing,-1,-2
Should we take out the other group now?,-1,-2
ahahaha sure,-1,-2
might as well strike first if duck is down,-1,-2
Who we killing first?,-1,-2
fried spider is kinda nasty,-1,-2
so them?,-1,-2
-12? or would that over kill them?,-1,-2
You both hit fried spider.  Ill hit Jing Leed,-1,-2
make sure to attack with everything,-1,-2
"Yep, everything",-1,-2
no we should all attack with everything i think,-1,-2
so liver still go for spider please,-1,-2
Everything on spider,-1,-2
Were too strong for that.  We wont get as much benefit,-1,-2
Dang liver,-1,-2
Not sure what I should do,-1,-2
Keeping,-1,-2
yeah thats fair,-1,-2
You folk abandoning me?,-1,-2
Im not worth much,-1,-2
I recommend you keep a good bit right now,-1,-2
Theyre a group again,-1,-2
yeah it seems like it,-1,-2
should we just strike for spider and try to weaken the group?,-1,-2
what do you think duck,-1,-2
Duck should keep?,-1,-2
Oyster and I go for spider?,-1,-2
if duck keeps well all just keep going down,-1,-2
we need to KILL,-1,-2
But duck needs to stay relevant.  Duck should keep,-1,-2
ok i take from LEED,-1,-2
Jing is lying to us,-1,-2
take from leed,-1,-2
duck did you keep?,-1,-2
Yes I kept ,-1,-2
I ran out of time,-1,-2
did they all attack you?,-1,-2
-9 from BS and -12 from JL,-1,-2
Keep again,-1,-2
ok thas terrible,-1,-2
"Oyster, we take out JL",-1,-2
Should we go for sausage? Take out the most powerful,-1,-2
sausage is so strong though,-1,-2
idk if we even have the strength to take out leed,-1,-2
Sausage is a dictator,-1,-2
And theyre only going to get stronger,-1,-2
who do we do then,-1,-2
i do leed,-1,-2
this is so bad,-1,-2
thoughts?,-1,-2
We gotta go all out on Sausage I think is the only way,-1,-2
We have to get JL and spider on our side,-1,-2
Taking out the lower people wont weaken them that much,-1,-2
ok i go for sausage,-1,-2
The other two arent trustworthy,-1,-2
i dont think this will work,-1,-2
Sausage is keeping too much,-1,-2
It probably wont tbh,-1,-2
We should at least give to each other,-1,-2
ok 6 to each?,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
Fine by me,-1,-2
until we receive word,-1,-2
Im nothing.  Dont give me so much,-1,-2
Give me a token or 2,-1,-2
im gonna do 8 and 4,-1,-2
Theyre just going to hit us soon,-1,-2
yeah probably,-1,-2
but theres nothing attacking will do,-1,-2
True,-1,-2
imma do 8:4 again,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
WOW,-1,-2
look at that,-1,-2
betrayal,-1,-2
You want us to join?,-1,-2

"i think we do the same thing, 8:4",-1,-2
but hope they take each other out,-1,-2
Fair point,-1,-2
Id say theres maybe 2 rounds left,-1,-2
"No, I think there is much more",-1,-2
It was a 30-40 round game,-1,-2
im not sure tbh,-1,-2
go for sausage or nah,-1,-2
Let say yes and then not,-1,-2
"Nah, theyre just trying to use us",-1,-2
yeah im just gonna do 8:4,-1,-2

actually yea true,-1,-2
theres nothing we can do anyway,-1,-2
If sausage goes down itll take everyone,-1,-2
well i guess ill take,-1,-2
while sausage is down we could all take from them again?? idk,-1,-2
Let do it,-1,-2
i think it would be suitably symbolic,-1,-2
ok im taking 12 from sausage again,-1,-2
All in on sausage?,-1,-2
But I dont want JL to win,-1,-2
Death to sausage,-1,-2
true but i hate sausage with all my heart,-1,-2

Nah attack one of them,-1,-2
Spider?,-1,-2
lol ok,-1,-2

I think we should form a trio,-1,-2
Sending you each 6,-1,-2
i agree ,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
6 each,-1,-2
same here,-1,-2
good one guys,-1,-2
lets keep it up until were super strong,-1,-2
Same plan,-1,-2
Although well have to do something soon about the other guys,-1,-2
Should we attack now?,-1,-2

Lets do it this round if we can,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2

Just follow my lead or we are dead,-1,-2
i ran out of time to resubmit,-1,-2
I have a target on my back now,-1,-2
"I think I am holding this round, Thoughts?",-1,-2
"you should have helped us up, we cant kill anyone if were low",-1,-2
i think its a good idea to hold,-1,-2
should we all hold?,-1,-2
Lets all hold ,-1,-2
Ill send you one though fried,-1,-2
"one? you owe me 6, you gave me nothing last round",-1,-2
Oh my gosh ,-1,-2
Im fending off an army,-1,-2
I will bring you back,-1,-2
Sending you both 2 this turn,-1,-2
Hold all your tokens,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Lets try and slowly raise you above Duck,-1,-2
Jing Lead? ,-1,-2
I can do whatever,-1,-2
Hold this roujd,-1,-2
next round we should attack Duck,-1,-2
whos in for -12 on duck?,-1,-2
lets do it,-1,-2
K,-1,-2
the other guys are trying to get us to betray blood,-1,-2
"im going to tell them im in, but I wont do it",-1,-2
Alright. Sending you each two,-1,-2
Lets start reciprocating agin,-1,-2
we need to get jing up,-1,-2
he needs more than 2,-1,-2
I guess we are strong enough now,-1,-2
4 each to balance out,-1,-2
4 each?,-1,-2
jing is loyal,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Were all loyal here. I think weve proven that,-1,-2
sound good,-1,-2
4 each and keep 4?,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
same thing?,-1,-2
Sounds good to me,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Same plan,-1,-2
Weve almost converged,-1,-2
"were stronger now, should we do 6 and 6?",-1,-2
Im on board,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
same plan?,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
"guys, i forgot to give :/",-1,-2
Well youre caught up at least,-1,-2
"that was a huge mistake, ill give 6 to both this round",-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
"blood sausage, forget to give me anything? ",-1,-2
yall down for this?,-1,-2
Seems logical to me,-1,-2
aight,-1,-2
ok do we want to attack or just give,-1,-2
Lets give 6 each,-1,-2
ok sure,-1,-2
Oof,-1,-2
sausage i will eat you alive,-1,-2
I chose the wrong friend,-1,-2
Sorry guys,-1,-2
Hear me out. You are welcome to drop me to zero,-1,-2
I want anyone but spider to win so lets nuke them,-1,-2
Jing betrayed me but spider has been crazy the whole game,-1,-2
we are attacking spider,-1,-2
join us or die,-1,-2
Join,-1,-2
imma take 12 from sausage just wanna let you know,-1,-2
Okay Imma keep cuz Im next,-1,-2
hmm,-1,-2
but if we both attack i think well be chillin,-1,-2
he might keep this round,-1,-2
Attack sausage next round?,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
im keeping,-1,-2
Want to join forces to be worth something together?,-1,-2
Good point.  We got trouble on our hands,-1,-2
Are we going to let sausage do this?,-1,-2
we should attack now,-1,-2
if we all attack theres nothing sausage can do,-1,-2
"If we dont do something this round, sausage will be a dictator",-1,-2
If we team together they cant block it all,-1,-2
spider and leed you down?,-1,-2
put the past behind us,-1,-2
its now or never folks,-1,-2
good point,-1,-2
im in for an all-out attack,-1,-2
"JL, your lies were obvious",-1,-2
Blood Sausage will stab you in the back,-1,-2
JL and Spider -- youve no chance.  Sausage is keeping a ton,-1,-2
you will not win with them around,-1,-2
its kinda hard to trust the people taking 12 from me every round,-1,-2
we will only take from sausage from now on,-1,-2
"to be fair, you also backstabbed us three rounds ago",-1,-2
"The problem is that you lied to us plus you wont respond to our petitions.  If you did, we could come together",-1,-2
We are ready to attack.  Just tell us when,-1,-2
"JL, are you honest in your dealings with your fellow men?",-1,-2
"You forget to submit, JL?",-1,-2
time to take out sausage,-1,-2
he betrayed me twice,-1,-2
-12 on sausage everyone,-1,-2
hmmmm,-1,-2
thats somewhat sus,-1,-2
Death to sausage,-1,-2
whos in? I cant do it alone,-1,-2
How much you taking from Sausage?,-1,-2
if jing leed actually acknowledges then maybe,-1,-2
"-12 if everyones in, but Im keeping if no one helps",-1,-2
if jing leeds is in then yes,-1,-2
Waiting for JL,-1,-2
"okay, im in",-1,-2
are you for real JL?,-1,-2
jing leed if you betray us we will be very angry,-1,-2
i will go -12 on blood sausage,-1,-2
lets do it,-1,-2
done,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
nice,-1,-2
"Now what, do you guys wanna rebuild?",-1,-2
we are killing sausage for the symbolic victory,-1,-2
try to reach an equilibrium?,-1,-2
help would be appreciated,-1,-2
sending you all 2,-1,-2
sorry i didnt have enough time but im in for giving equally everyone,-1,-2
2 to each?  But my 2 aint worth much.,-1,-2
is everyone in for 2 each?,-1,-2
i knew to not give you guys haha,-1,-2
What are your thoughts on spider?,-1,-2
"I think we should work with them, but they seem anxious ",-1,-2
I agree,-1,-2
Lets just keep eachother informed if they try something funny,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Sending you 6 this round,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
spider doesnt trust you. they want to betray you eventually,-1,-2
I knew something was up with that guy,-1,-2
What do you want to do,-1,-2
"I say we keep giving 6 for now, Ill try to see what his plan is",-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
We won the original battle so the chat game is over for me lol,-1,-2
I think we keep giving eachother 6 and dont give to spider.... Thoughts?,-1,-2
I agree,-1,-2
k,-1,-2
Why did you drop? ,-1,-2
i dont know,-1,-2
Did you give them tokens,-1,-2
"Oh, I think i didnt resubmit fast enough",-1,-2
theyre coming for you in force though,-1,-2
Just give eacother r this round,-1,-2
4,-1,-2
Okay I will hold,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
Okay I will hold,-1,-2
Give eachother 2,-1,-2
4 this time?,-1,-2
did anyone attack you?,-1,-2
No attacks,-1,-2
Im surprised,-1,-2
nobody trusts each other to mount an attack :),-1,-2
Do you think they are coming for you?,-1,-2
"No, i think im safe",-1,-2
Lets just do 3 to eachother and play it safe,-1,-2
Same plan?,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
Send 1 to liver tacos,-1,-2
Just to make things interesting haha,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
Fair enough,-1,-2
Good luck,-1,-2
Ill still send you 3,-1,-2
I wanted you to win from the start,-1,-2
you are better than this game deserves,-1,-2
Haha. One gets tired of the bloodshed,-1,-2
I could have won on round three but it just didnt feel right,-1,-2
Its about the friends you make along the way,-1,-2
Nuking spider,-1,-2
"no, lets be peaceful",-1,-2
I dont think spider will let that happen but I follow you,-1,-2
ill see if he does this round,-1,-2
"if not, we all take him out",-1,-2
"blood sausage is too strong, he will stab us in the back. we should help each other",-1,-2
"ok, i want to see what they do this round",-1,-2
what should we do?,-1,-2
after this round I think we will be strong enough,-1,-2
give 6 each this round,-1,-2
I thought we were friends,-1,-2
you didnt give me anything though,-1,-2
do you want an alliance or no?,-1,-2
that was low of you to not reciprocate,-1,-2
haha sorry i thought we had more time and i didnt trust you,-1,-2
trying to make some friends!,-1,-2
Me too Jing,-1,-2
me three,-1,-2
Alright everyone,-1,-2
This is absurd,-1,-2
Hey people at the bottom. We arent attacking you. You are welcome to trade with eachother,-1,-2
lets try to rebuild. Ill send everyone 2,-1,-2
Spider wont let that happen,-1,-2
THey are blood thirsty,-1,-2
I follow Jing. He said not to attack,-1,-2
Of course Jing was Josh,-1,-2
Good job Ivett,-1,-2
haha thank you,-1,-2
Group?,-1,-2
Yup,-1,-2
Yes sir,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
6 each?,-1,-2
Works for me,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
how bout 5 this round and we have freedom on the other 3,-1,-2
Stay consistent please. With the poverty line it is much less advantageous to try to steal or betray someone.,-1,-2
"Im going to go with 6, but Im fine if Juliett does 5.",-1,-2
Sending 6 again. Should we pick up november?,-1,-2
Maybe so.,-1,-2
Im down,-1,-2
Im fine with that. They gave me 3.,-1,-2
Ill give 5 to each of you and 3 to November.,-1,-2
Im doing 4 to november and 5 to the lower 2,-1,-2
Want to team up?,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
im giving you each 9,-1,-2
same,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
oh,-1,-2
sorry I forgot to,-1,-2
submit,-1,-2
you guys dont have to give me this round,-1,-2
what are you doing this round?,-1,-2
giving you guys 9 each,-1,-2
do we want to bring in nov and fox?,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
im down...? what do you guys thing,-1,-2
think*,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
!,-1,-2
Im game,-1,-2
Ill make a new chat,-1,-2
thanks,-1,-2
make a team?,-1,-2
Ive joined another group but lets stay friends,-1,-2
Same here,-1,-2
smae,-1,-2
Are you interested in being friends?,-1,-2
"Sorry, Ive already found some friends.",-1,-2
Happy to have a non-aggression pact though,-1,-2
"hey, we expand the group to include me?",-1,-2
ill give you each 6 this round and you can decide next round,-1,-2
yeah!,-1,-2
do you need someone else in your team?,-1,-2
Sounds good!,-1,-2
Ill make a new chat,-1,-2
Can we get November to join us?,-1,-2
yeah we are working on it,-1,-2
quebec?,-1,-2
are you creating a room?,-1,-2
Should we talk in here?,-1,-2
I think so,-1,-2
6 to each? ,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
yeah same as last time,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
chat here.  Nov for now wants to be in the other group,-1,-2
"sorry, used the wrong chat",-1,-2
May be we need to contact ,-1,-2
each of them?,-1,-2
what do you guys think?,-1,-2
Im not sure.,-1,-2
do we seem desparate and coniving if we do that?,-1,-2
I think it would be hard to convince anyone to jump ship,-1,-2
agree,-1,-2
what if we all just give like 2 to hotel and see if they help?,-1,-2
or would that make things worse,-1,-2
it would give that group more strength,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
true,-1,-2
How about suggeting a whole union,-1,-2
thatd be interesting,-1,-2
Or can we make one of them look suspicious?,-1,-2
uniform? any thoughts,-1,-2
"Im not sure, this game is diff with the poverty line",-1,-2
We can suggest november to be the top 1 if he helps us.,-1,-2
we can start attacking them,-1,-2
but that can be,-1,-2
dangerous,-1,-2
didnt papa said we werent fighting this time,-1,-2
in the global chat,-1,-2
Sorry I missed that one,-1,-2
But can we believe them?,-1,-2
"we can for the time being, at poverty we have 200 pop which is a deterent for now",-1,-2
...Im dumb,-1,-2
No worries,-1,-2
what happened?,-1,-2
thought I had things allocated and hit submit but didnt,-1,-2
that actually helps us if you keep giving,-1,-2
because you have higher popularity,-1,-2
"it will hurt us a little altogether, but no worries at all",-1,-2
"okay, 6s to you all, again sorry",-1,-2
What if we picked a winner from our group,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
We could get uniform ahead and cause a stir,-1,-2
that could be a good idea,-1,-2
i like that,-1,-2
that seems a bit iffy to me,-1,-2
8 to uniform and 5 to the others???,-1,-2
down,-1,-2
next round,-1,-2
You dont like it uniform?,-1,-2
just feels unfair but also makes a lot of sense since it keeps the power flow in the group,-1,-2
Lets do it!!!,-1,-2
great!,-1,-2
might as well try!,-1,-2
Only bad thing is it might make uniform a target,-1,-2
see,-1,-2
how they react,-1,-2
"yeah, if they arent attacking like they said",-1,-2
i guess well find out,-1,-2
agreed,-1,-2
4-4-10?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
"okay, still feels unfair to you all",-1,-2
it is just a game,-1,-2
no worry,-1,-2
next round should be the last?,-1,-2
give all?,-1,-2
haha,-1,-2
Uniform: keep,-1,-2
you sure?,-1,-2
The rest of us can do 4-4-10,-1,-2
great!,-1,-2
I want a winner from our group!,-1,-2
smae!,-1,-2
Still more time!,-1,-2
Yay!,-1,-2
what now?,-1,-2
How about 6-6-6.  Uniform keep?,-1,-2
okay for that,-1,-2
alright,-1,-2
you sure you want me to keep?,-1,-2
Yes -- incase they attack you it will blunt it a bit,-1,-2
hopefully this game ends soon ,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Or we could attack them :-),-1,-2
...again Im dumb,-1,-2
uniform all?,-1,-2
you gave to us,-1,-2
I had it pre allocated 666,-1,-2
forgetting that I had done that,-1,-2
Everything to uniform!  Uniform keep,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Whats the deal with Juliett?,-1,-2
maybe they are trying to copy?,-1,-2
thats what I think too,-1,-2
could be :),-1,-2
Juliett kept some,-1,-2
"Nice, Victory, eh?",-1,-2
Would you like to join our group?,-1,-2
I think I got us all,-1,-2
We are willing to have you in our group November,-1,-2
thanks!,-1,-2
"I think we are all giving you 3 this time, and will probably increase as we have consistency",-1,-2
Same. We can discuss a better deal next round,-1,-2
Do you want to do 3 again? or go up to 4,-1,-2
"November, just know, you cant be friends with everyone. Youll need to decide between this group or the other eventually.",-1,-2
Sending 5 to papa and bravo and 4 to November and ki;es,-1,-2
yeah im choosing you guys,-1,-2
*jules,-1,-2
Does that sound good?,-1,-2
Im going to 4 and 5 on the lower 2,-1,-2
Please dont build up the other group unless they are building us up.,-1,-2
Sending 5 to the lower to and 4 to the upper two,-1,-2
Im matching Hotel,-1,-2
shoot,-1,-2
im literally not sending anything to them guys,-1,-2
All good. They know you are with us now,-1,-2
"Well be keeping an eye on that for now, just stay consistent with us in giving.",-1,-2
I bet they attack us soon,-1,-2
"Im giving 3 to November, and 5 to others.",-1,-2
Same as bravo,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
im giving 4 to papa & juliett 5 to bravo hotel,-1,-2
Still 4 to the highest and 5 to the lowest?,-1,-2
that sounds good to me,-1,-2
4 to highest and 5 to lowest for me,-1,-2
kk,-1,-2
Beautiful convergence there,-1,-2
"If they attack first, well respond accordingly, but until then lets maintain our current strategy.",-1,-2
"Yep, Im curious to see how much variation there will be between the two groups as we get more convergence as we go.",-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
4s and 5s,-1,-2
Its literally leapfrog,-1,-2
We could at one point agree to a circualar alternating strategy to avoid the leapfrog. Id like to come to a consensus though so we know what is happening.,-1,-2
Starting next round I agree,-1,-2
circualar alternating strategy?,-1,-2
Yeah we dont have much time in this round,-1,-2
how would that work?,-1,-2
Whatever the line up is next round will decide,-1,-2
I think the other group would take advantage of that strategy.,-1,-2
First gives to second down to fourth who loops to first,-1,-2
Thoughts?,-1,-2
5th I mean,-1,-2
That might work. Havent thought it through,-1,-2
Make sure to submit,-1,-2
So everyone would give 5 to three people and 3 to the 4th,-1,-2
Yes? No?,-1,-2
Follow what weve been doing until this has been explained better.,-1,-2
agreed,-1,-2
"I agree, this is hard to explain",-1,-2
1 ->2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1,-1,-2
5 5 5 3,-1,-2
"So for example in this round I would have given 5 to everyone but November, November would give 5 to everyone except Bravo, and so on down the list?",-1,-2
Thats the best I can describe the pattern,-1,-2
Yes papa. Starting next round if we choose to,-1,-2
Objections?,-1,-2
SO the person directly below us gets 3,-1,-2
How does the person in 3rd or 4th behave?,-1,-2
"You skip the person directly below you, give 5 to everyone else, and 3 to that person",-1,-2
ok so i give everyone 5 except juliett (3),-1,-2
Does everyone understand?,-1,-2
I see now.,-1,-2
Yes. So I would give 3 to bravo and 5 to everyone else,-1,-2
Yes November,-1,-2
I give 5 to all except hotel,-1,-2
Yes everyone. All in?,-1,-2
Oui,-1,-2
Yes,-1,-2
got it yep,-1,-2
Yup Im in. And we will keep these token exchanges per person not per rank,-1,-2
This round then. Lets see how much we stabilize,-1,-2
We will call out each round so it is abundantly clear,-1,-2
"Yeah, keep it per person to stay stable I think.",-1,-2
"I always give 3 to November, etc.",-1,-2
That seemed to do it!,-1,-2
I always give 3 to Papa,-1,-2
Yep,-1,-2
Giving 3 to bravo,-1,-2
3 to hotel,-1,-2
3 to Juliett,-1,-2
"Just match your last token allocation, dont worry about the person giving 3 to you, since you will get 5 from the other people in the group",-1,-2
Yes that is true,-1,-2
Im giving 3 to November,-1,-2
"Wow, that was more complex to explain and coordinate than I expected",-1,-2
Finally got there though,-1,-2
wow,-1,-2
they boosted uniform,-1,-2
Ignore it,-1,-2
They are trying to provoke us.,-1,-2
Agreed. Stay with the current plan,-1,-2
yeah it doesnt matter,-1,-2
If they attack we will  respond ,-1,-2
"If they attack, next we each keep the 3 that we normally give to the circular person.",-1,-2
"Just let them fall naturally, we dont need to attack.",-1,-2
Id say drop to 4 tokens each and keep 3,-1,-2
That way the circle is maintained,-1,-2
If we are attacked,-1,-2
Sure that would work too.,-1,-2
I like Hotels suggestion.,-1,-2
How do we help the person who falls?,-1,-2
if we do 4 each that only leaves 2,-1,-2
4 4 4 3,-1,-2
We can figure it out as needed.,-1,-2
I almost didnt submit scary,-1,-2
"Fortunately we dont need to worry about it. Make sure to submit first thing, then we can coordinate",-1,-2
agreed,-1,-2
"We might even converge to the same popularity by the end. That would be cool, we all win with the same popularity",-1,-2
Were almost there,-1,-2
keep it up!,-1,-2
Did anyone get attacked?,-1,-2
huh?,-1,-2
hotel what the heck,-1,-2
what happened to our beautiful structure,-1,-2
I told the underlings of the other group that Uniform is trying join us.,-1,-2
What happened!,-1,-2
Oh,-1,-2
Bravo can you explain?,-1,-2
I sent juliett 3,-1,-2
I lost my focus,-1,-2
and I sent bravo 5,-1,-2
"I dont know why I jumped up, I was just trying to spook them.",-1,-2
"Oh, so the circle broke because of Hotel misallocated.",-1,-2
I got 5 from everyone. I see that now.,-1,-2
I ruined it so sorry. We were so close,-1,-2
Hotel you send to Juliet right?,-1,-2
I sent jules 3 on accident,-1,-2
Go back to how we had it,-1,-2
I should get 5 from hotel,-1,-2
we can adjust,-1,-2
i give 3 to juliett still,-1,-2
Will we converge again?,-1,-2
Sending 3 to bravo and 5 to jules,-1,-2
Okay. Time to kill victor and foxtrot,-1,-2
I sent one extra to juliet as well last round to try to fix it.,-1,-2
wait papa you gave 5 to me instead of 3,-1,-2
Papa only gave 4?,-1,-2
i oly got 4 from papa,-1,-2
ok wait what are we doing about uniform?,-1,-2
Juliett didnt send me any,-1,-2
I think we kill victor and quebec,-1,-2
Thoughts?,-1,-2
No war yet,-1,-2
"Man, totally got confused. Should we just take out the bottom like Hotel suggested.",-1,-2
Im fine with no war.,-1,-2
"giving 3 to bravo, 5 to everyone else",-1,-2
Okay. Same as usual. Jules send me 5,-1,-2
Im back to giving 3 to November,-1,-2
wait no,-1,-2
we do it based on who is beneath us,-1,-2
I am staying with the previous strategy.,-1,-2
No no,-1,-2
Same people,-1,-2
Im lost,-1,-2
the only way its gonna converge is if we choose the person beneath us right?,-1,-2
Reset who our person who receives 3. I will give 3 to Juliett. ,-1,-2
Agreed,-1,-2
i give 3 to papa,-1,-2
"No, we converge by doing the circular strategy, otherwise we would be leapfroging.",-1,-2
3 to hotel,-1,-2
Sending 3 to november,-1,-2
3 to November,-1,-2
Weight Hotel why are you sending 3 to november?,-1,-2
no papa you do 3 to bravo,-1,-2
cause we do the person beneath us,-1,-2
^^,-1,-2
Papa you send 3 to bravo,-1,-2
We are resetting this mess,-1,-2
"Okay, 3 to Bravo",-1,-2
Everyone certain who gets 3?,-1,-2
"Sorry about the confusion, I didnt realize we were resetting",-1,-2
"Also, thoughts on Uniform? Or are we more concerned with convergence?",-1,-2
Convergence,-1,-2
k,-1,-2
this might be last round tbh,-1,-2
Uni is just trying to play us,-1,-2
Thanks for the 5.  Im giving you some this round,-1,-2
Sending you 6,-1,-2
Happy to be a friend if you want to be a friend,-1,-2
"i cant give you anything right now, but we can be friends on the dl if youd like",-1,-2
and ill let you know if youre in any danger!,-1,-2
Sounds good  and thx,-1,-2
Heres the new group,-1,-2

november? are you in our team?,-1,-2
im sorry i think im not able to contribute to you at this point,-1,-2
"Nov -- you can straddle the teams, but just let us know how much you are going to give us",-1,-2
Should we not give to nov this time,-1,-2
Im giving the others 6,-1,-2
6 to each then?,-1,-2
ok,-1,-2
How can we gain? do we need to befriend one of them at some point?,-1,-2
I think so,-1,-2
Uniform is trying to negotiate joining our group. Watch out for betrayal.,-1,-2
you sure?,-1,-2
What do we believe?,-1,-2
I dont believe Bravo,-1,-2
neither,-1,-2
I am,-1,-2
uniform is trying not to do that,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
so I can believe,-1,-2
uniform,-1,-2
"yeah uniform is still giving, so i think its okay",-1,-2
Anyone want to be friends?,-1,-2
Non-Aggression Pact. In a poverty line game it really isnt advantageous to fight. Lets just see how much popularity we can get. (Dr. Crandall will pay us in chocolate or something),-1,-2
Sounds good 2 me,-1,-2
want to team up?,-1,-2
Yes lets do it,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
nice we did goog,-1,-2
good,-1,-2
whats the strat,-1,-2
hmm not sure,-1,-2
maybe build up popularity and then take others down?,-1,-2
i like it,-1,-2
im giving half to you and then keeping,-1,-2
ok thats probably smart,-1,-2
any ideas? ive got a decent amount of influence,-1,-2
palying defensively would probably be good but ill give you like 6 to boost you up,-1,-2
playing,-1,-2
k sounds good,-1,-2
giving you 4,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
we are crushing this,-1,-2
lol yes we are,-1,-2
should we both launch an attack on zulu?,-1,-2
yeah how many you think,-1,-2
im think 10 each,-1,-2
ok sounds good,-1,-2
and keep the rest for defense,-1,-2
at this point we should just give each other like 6 a round and then keep for defense because i imagine ppl will come at us pretty hard,-1,-2
yeah that works,-1,-2
lol they made a chat with everyone but you,-1,-2
lol,-1,-2
it seems like its working ,-1,-2
"i would maybe keep all for defense, they are all teaming up on you",-1,-2
i dont imagine anyone will come after me,-1,-2
yeah ill defend,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
"I did 6 for you and 10 for defense, you do whatever you think is best",-1,-2
giving you 4 to keep you up,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
they came after you hard,-1,-2
"ok i think just defend, maybe 2-4 to each other and we can stay on top",-1,-2
i like it,-1,-2
its working,-1,-2
we got this,-1,-2
good stuff,-1,-2
niiice,-1,-2
"I think it would be kind of funny to go ham and both take from someone, but thats kinda risky",-1,-2
and our current strat is working really well,-1,-2
yeah whatever youre thinking im down,-1,-2
not this one but the next we should bomb zulu,-1,-2
ok im down,-1,-2
lets do it,-1,-2
how many you doing?,-1,-2
"i did all of mine, but you can do whatever",-1,-2
im all in,-1,-2
lets goo,-1,-2
holy crap haha,-1,-2
now we gotta defend,-1,-2
amen,-1,-2
all for defense now,-1,-2
yep,-1,-2
oh boy hopefully we can survive this,-1,-2
this is so funny ,-1,-2
what now,-1,-2
same thing?,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
dang man we practically killed zulu,-1,-2
hes gone lol,-1,-2
you wanna go back to 3 and 13?,-1,-2
or stay?,-1,-2
yes,-1,-2
3 and 13,-1,-2
because giving does more than defending,-1,-2
yea,-1,-2
sweet,-1,-2
shoot did they attack you,-1,-2
idk 198 isnt too bad,-1,-2
you went down though did they get you,-1,-2
shoot youre right,-1,-2
what you thinking,-1,-2
who was it?,-1,-2
everyone bro,-1,-2
i think they are alternating,-1,-2
between me and yu,-1,-2
ok just defend then,-1,-2
lessgo,-1,-2
wanna coordinate an attack on Sierra?,-1,-2
Maybe later,-1,-2
fair enough,-1,-2
I dont want to attack too early,-1,-2
"since were at the bottom, would you like to form an alliance to climb back up together?",-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
i saw that you attacked whiskey so im also attacking them,-1,-2

"Im boosting you, +10",-1,-2
"thanks, ill boost too",-1,-2
im attacking zulu and tango this time,-1,-2
ill do same,-1,-2
Ill push you up for whatever its worth at this point,-1,-2
wanna boost each other to get over zulu?,-1,-2
yeah sure ,-1,-2
orbital strike on Whiskey,-1,-2
"I think whiskey is defending, maybe sierra wouldnt expect it ",-1,-2
Ok we should probably strike next turn ,-1,-2
lets hit sierra with everything?,-1,-2

Im doing it again,-1,-2
why not,-1,-2
ill give you intel about whos and when is planning on attacking you if you are willing to boost me,-1,-2
anybody wanna form an alliance?,-1,-2

Sure,-1,-2
"Im giving the same to everybody, but those who want an alliance Ill give 2x",-1,-2
We making this a coop game now?,-1,-2

Friends?,-1,-2
Sure,-1,-2
yeah!,-1,-2
Rotate the odd token,-1,-2
Sounds good.,-1,-2
Round 2,-1,-2
Lima gave none,-1,-2
Lima gave none to me as well,-1,-2
I got some from lima,-1,-2
Lima? ,-1,-2
"Sorry guys, fixing that now",-1,-2
Round 3,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2
"Have you properly repented, Lima?",-1,-2
We are willing to take you back lima,-1,-2
Just stay as consistent as you currently are.,-1,-2
Round 6,-1,-2
"Lima, no chat makes us feel sketchy about you. Respond.",-1,-2
"I do believe so, sounds good to me",-1,-2
Thanks guys,-1,-2
I kind of wish we had a typing... thing,-1,-2
That would be nice,-1,-2
Quebec gave 1 token to me,-1,-2
Round 7,-1,-2
"Foxtrot, Ill make it up to you",-1,-2
Ive been giving single tokens to delta and uniform on occasion.,-1,-2
Same here with uniform,-1,-2
"Have they been responding equally? If not, dont let them sucker you into leaking tokens into their group",-1,-2
"Yeah, its been small give and take.",-1,-2
"On a side note, are we going to attack first?",-1,-2
"Victor, why did you drop",-1,-2
Victors popularity took a slight downturn. What happened?,-1,-2
Had a round where delta and uniform didnt give any. Thats my only guess.,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
Ive been nuked,-1,-2
Who attacked?,-1,-2
How to respond?,-1,-2
Everyone,-1,-2
Attack Uniform?,-1,-2
"Everyone keep, our average is higher",-1,-2
I think that will buy us some time to assess the situation,-1,-2
Im below the poverty line so they cant do anything to me,-1,-2
Ill still attack,-1,-2
"Yeah, X-ray is fine to attack",-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
"Victor, did you not keep?",-1,-2
Fox is probably next,-1,-2
We should retaliate while fox keeps,-1,-2
Delta already tried getting me.,-1,-2
Ill keep,-1,-2
Anyone close to poverty can attack without fear of retaliation.,-1,-2
Im going for their king,-1,-2
"They  all attacked me, but I kept",-1,-2
They overpowered the keep,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
This aint good,-1,-2
The only thing we can do now is take out their power by sucking from the one that is least likely to keep for protection. Leak from Delta,-1,-2
Aight all in on delta,-1,-2
"Some of us should build each other up, while the others take from their weakest that they will be most willing to drop",-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Unfortunately the power aspect of the game has brought me very far down.,-1,-2
All 4 attacked me when I dropped,-1,-2
We need to build each other up enough to be able to have an effect on their most weak player.,-1,-2
"Are we attacking, or just trying to build up again?",-1,-2
"If we dont build each other up, we dont have enough influence to really affect them.",-1,-2
But we also cant let them grow too much.,-1,-2
Should we just build up one at a time or spread it out,-1,-2
"Drop me for now, itll take a lot to build me up since I went so far negative.",-1,-2
"Probably spread it out, but a little more to the lowest?",-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
Build up Victor,-1,-2
okau,-1,-2
okay*,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
Lets bring back Foxtrot?,-1,-2
"Our pop will grow at the same rate as the other group, can we even get out of this?",-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
"Can we bring Fox back to life? I have given some, but it has no effect.",-1,-2
Same,-1,-2
I think fox just got hit really hard,-1,-2
what if we just give all,-1,-2
Lets give it a go!,-1,-2
"Yes you can bring me back, it would take a little while though, keep building each other up and give just a few tokens to me",-1,-2
"If you give all, you three will drop",-1,-2
Since you wont get anything,-1,-2
Round 16,-1,-2
I just dont know how we will take the top people out,-1,-2

It looks like Lima is friends with Uniform,-1,-2
Uniform also gave to me.,-1,-2
7 to each of you,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
Should we include uniform in oru group?,-1,-2
"Not sure, seems inconsistent",-1,-2
Lets adopt someone besides Lima. Way too sketchy.,-1,-2
Who then?,-1,-2
Quebec,-1,-2
I think Delta. Quebec is too connected to Uniform and Zulu.,-1,-2
"Yes, I was going to say the same.",-1,-2
Changed.,-1,-2
They kinda have a group with the four of them,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2
Lima has been left out of that group. Is that punishment enough? Should we adopt Lima back?,-1,-2
Maybe. They have been giving 4 the last few rounds.,-1,-2
Adopt Lima as a lesser member,-1,-2

Hi Delta. We think you should join our group,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
4 each?,-1,-2
Sounds good,-1,-2
Yeah. NExt round though,-1,-2
Round 3,-1,-2
Ran out of time,-1,-2
4 each ,-1,-2
?,-1,-2
yee,-1,-2
or 5? I miss counted,-1,-2
Lets do 5 each,-1,-2
Hold the last token or should we try to stagger it?,-1,-2
I did not give delta last time so I will give the last one to delta,-1,-2
I give uniform 7 uniform zulu 7 zulu delta 7 delta me 7?,-1,-2
Actually yeah good Idea,-1,-2
Ill give my extra to delta,-1,-2
Round 4,-1,-2
Nice delta,-1,-2
It looks like two groups of four have emerged,-1,-2
"I think we go 5 5 6 with the 6 to the lowest that isnt yourself to pull up the bottom, thoughts?",-1,-2
agree,-1,-2
I think that is a good idea. What if we give the extra to the other team though to try and make us a more stable society,-1,-2
sure,-1,-2
THoughts?,-1,-2
i would rather do that,-1,-2
I would rather do that as well,-1,-2
K. Next round we will coordinate,-1,-2
cool,-1,-2
Round 5,-1,-2
Should we all give to one person or split evenly?,-1,-2
Should we try to take advantage of Lima being low?,-1,-2
"I got 1 from victor, so Imma reciprocate",-1,-2
Ill send one to xray,-1,-2
Round 6,-1,-2
Were all very even now,-1,-2
It looks like it is a group of three. Lima is not growing with them,-1,-2
but lima is not saving tokens though,-1,-2
Right. They are being taken advantage of,-1,-2
yeah lima is just good at trading,-1,-2
not good at,-1,-2
Round 7,-1,-2
I think we should strike x ray,-1,-2
They dont have numbers,-1,-2
How much for everyone?,-1,-2
Like we each use everything at him?,-1,-2
Throw everything at him,-1,-2
okay!,-1,-2
Then we will go back to 5 when they are out,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
just x ray?,-1,-2
or when they are all gone?,-1,-2
Just x ray yes,-1,-2
All in on xray and we will talk next round,-1,-2
Round 8,-1,-2
oh my,-1,-2
Awesome,-1,-2
Okay. I think we all hold this round,-1,-2
I think Im gonna keep most of my tokens yeah,-1,-2
What are your thoughts,-1,-2
They are gonna attack us,-1,-2
defenetly,-1,-2
we should keep fighting,-1,-2
they have so little power we probably could pick them all off,-1,-2
Holding will block the attack. But we do have the numbers to crush them,-1,-2
okay,-1,-2
Lets just go for victor,-1,-2
hold this round?,-1,-2
all in on victor,-1,-2
okay!,-1,-2
best to attack not keep,-1,-2
No. We can crush them,-1,-2
We will build whoever is hit as retribution,-1,-2
sounds good,-1,-2
Round 9,-1,-2
delta you didnt attack?,-1,-2
Did foxtrot attack anyone?,-1,-2
nobe,-1,-2
"I hit foxtrot cause of the poverty line mechanics, dont wanna overkill",-1,-2
oh ok,-1,-2
is foxtrot next?,-1,-2
Okay. Lets hit him next then? Do we mess with Lima?,-1,-2
I feel like we leave lima personally but,-1,-2
idk,-1,-2
but they all are saving tokens we should all hit them to take them down completely,-1,-2
"I think foxtrot kept, so all in on them?",-1,-2
We can let them know we wont bother them if they stay out,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
all in yeah,-1,-2
Round 10,-1,-2
"Okay now we are dominant, Xray is keep attacking us",-1,-2
yeah x-ray tried to steal from me,-1,-2
so we should completely take him down?,-1,-2
we cant anymore right?,-1,-2
because of poverty mechanics?,-1,-2
Lets just go back to giving eachother 5,-1,-2
okay!,-1,-2
"we cant fully kill people, the poverty line will keep them alive and lower the benefit to us",-1,-2
Okay!,-1,-2
Hold your extra token,-1,-2
Round 11,-1,-2
Great job everyone!,-1,-2
we won!,-1,-2
yeeeeee,-1,-2
And no one died!,-1,-2
Its weird they didnt seem to fight back,-1,-2
"also, xray and victor both hit me for -16 and lima for -1",-1,-2
I agree. I was expecting more resistance but maybe they caught on too late,-1,-2
yeah its possible they werent very coordinated,-1,-2
Lets keep giving as we are and we can adjust it if you keep losing popularity,-1,-2
"yeah either way, 5 5 5 keep 1 seems goot",-1,-2
*good,-1,-2
Round 12,-1,-2
I vote we just kill them. They are dropping us a bit,-1,-2
oh wait foxtrot is dead,-1,-2
Lets do 4 to eachother and 4 to Xray,-1,-2
"we cant, theyll keep falling as we get bigger but the poverty makes it hard",-1,-2
Oh okay,-1,-2
to kill people,-1,-2
I will,-1,-2
5s it is,-1,-2
"also, quebec, what about xray?",-1,-2
I was going to say to attack them but I guess we cant do anything about the poverty line,-1,-2
Round 13,-1,-2
I attacked x-ray,-1,-2
yeah none of them are getting out of poverty,-1,-2
Did they drop because of it Zulu?,-1,-2
looks like it,-1,-2
yeah,-1,-2
Maybe the poverty line isnt working as intended,-1,-2
"interesting, we might need to agdjust the poverty a bit",-1,-2
Sending you each 5,-1,-2
that means we could kill them all?,-1,-2
i am sending 5 to each as well,-1,-2
Id expect the continual fall from us growing but attacking shouldnt work...,-1,-2
I think so? But lets just keep going as is,-1,-2
ok sounds good,-1,-2
Round 14,-1,-2
sending 5,-1,-2
I think we can igoner them from now on. There are huge gaps unless one of us help them to grow,-1,-2
Round 15,-1,-2
5 each?,-1,-2
Yeah,-1,-2
yep,-1,-2
you know it :),-1,-2
Im content. We already won haha,-1,-2
yeah this was very successful,-1,-2
I will give 1 token to foxtrot to see how they would react on the new member of them. So do not surprise by that,-1,-2
